Any ideas or workarounds before resorting to the above? Click to expand... Use Carbon Copy Cloner to copy one drive to the other. I've done this several times going from larger HDD to smaller SSD and I wound up with a bootable SSD drive. One step you have to remember not to skip is to use Disk Utility to partition the SSD as GUID partition scheme HFS+ before doing the clone. If it came Apple Partition Scheme, even if you let CCC do the clone, the resulting drive won't be bootable. CCC usually works in "file mode" and it can easily copy a larger drive (that's mostly empty) onto a smaller drive. If you tell CCC to clone a drive you did NOT boot from, it can work in block copy mode where the destination drive must be the same size or larger than the drive you are cloning from (if I recall). share Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Email Link Like + Quote Reply xgman, Jan 20, 2012 xgman macrumors 601 Joined: Aug 6, 2007 #3 I've actually done this somehow on Disk Utility several times (booting from a different drive (or even the dvd) so not running disk utility from the drive your cloning) and had it work just fine from larger to smaller bootable clone.

My only experience using DU to go larger to smaller was when I was trying to make a Lion install stick and I was unable to restore InstallESD.dmg to a 4 GB USB stick but of course the reason that wouldn't fit is there was slightly more than 4 GB of data. share Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Email Link Like + Quote Reply (You must log in or sign up to post here.)

PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds for smartphones now available around the world | Abacus Uh oh, your network is slow Read PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds for smartphones now available around the world Uh oh, your network is slow PUBG MOBILE RELEASED WORLDWIDE DIGITAL LIFE Read PUBG PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds for smartphones now available around the world Tencent’s official port of hit PC game is out everywhere Ravi Hiranand Published on 20 Mar, 2018 2:45pm Coordinated Universal Time PUBG PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds for smartphones now available around the world Tencent’s official port of hit PC game is out everywhere One of the biggest games in the world is now available on smartphones around the world thanks to Tencent. The Chinese company’s official port of PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds (PUBG) is now available on iOS and Android worldwide. We tried PUBG on iPhone X when it released in China last month and came away very impressed. It successfully squeezed much of the PC and Xbox game down to a much smaller screen -- and in places looked even better than the Xbox One version of the game. Tencent's PUBG for iPhone (above) compared to the Xbox One version (below) It comes a week after rival Fortnite began inviting players to test its own mobile version. Unlike PUBG, Fortnite will allow players to play across platforms -- meaning iPhone players can kill or be killed by gamers on PC or PlayStation 4. Fortnite recently surpassed pioneer PUBG in popularity. Both games feature 100 players landing on a deserted island filled with weapons, with everyone fighting to be the last person left standing. While PUBG adopts a realistic setting, Fortnite has a more cartoon-like look -- and an emphasis on building structures sets it apart from its rival. But Tencent may find its main competition for PUBG on mobile could come from other Chinese companies. NetEase was quick to copy PUBG and released similar games for smartphone while the original was still on PC. NetEase says just one of its clones, Knives Out, has over 100 million registered players -- far more than the 40 million playing PUBG on PC and Xbox. PUBG Gaming Smartphones Tencent Digital Life Uh oh, your network is slow Read

A cooperative worldwide effort to rescue Thailand children trapped in a flooded cave rescued them all in less than 3 weeks from the time they entered the cave to the time of their rescue. Hurrah! A cooperative worldwide effort to rescue Thailand children trapped in a flooded cave rescued them all in less than 3 weeks from the time they entered the cave to the time of their rescue. It should be much easier, shouldn’t even take a heroic effort, to rescue children trapped in separation from their families at the Mexican border. These things are possible, but this week, the administration did not even meet the first deadline to get all the children below 5 years old reunited with their families. It should even be logistically possible with a cooperative world wide effort to develop economic systems that could rescue all the hungry children everywhere living in poverty. In the U.S. alone, 1 in 5 children live in poverty, according to a recently released United Nations report. In Maine, according to Maine Equal Justice Partners, since the election of Gov. Paul LePage in 2010, childhood poverty has risen, with “one out of every 13 children [now] living in extreme or ‘deep poverty.’” Such inequality and poverty is a direct result of economic policies that are chosen by elected leaders. The solution is to elect different leaders than the ones in power now. Please consider carefully when you vote this November.

Discussion in 'Mac OS X Lion (10.7)' started by axboi87, Jan 20, 2012. I've got a 500gb internal drive and a 240gb SSD. When trying to restore using disk utility i'm given the error "Not enough space on disk ____ to restore" But I shouldn't have to do that!!! Any ideas or workarounds before resorting to the above? Use Carbon Copy Cloner to copy one drive to the other. I've done this several times going from larger HDD to smaller SSD and I wound up with a bootable SSD drive. One step you have to remember not to skip is to use Disk Utility to partition the SSD as GUID partition scheme HFS+ before doing the clone. If it came Apple Partition Scheme, even if you let CCC do the clone, the resulting drive won't be bootable. CCC usually works in "file mode" and it can easily copy a larger drive (that's mostly empty) onto a smaller drive. If you tell CCC to clone a drive you did NOT boot from, it can work in block copy mode where the destination drive must be the same size or larger than the drive you are cloning from (if I recall). I've actually done this somehow on Disk Utility several times (booting from a different drive (or even the dvd) so not running disk utility from the drive your cloning) and had it work just fine from larger to smaller bootable clone. Definitely format the drive cloning to first, as bootable Apple etc.. Thanks for pointing this out. My only experience using DU to go larger to smaller was when I was trying to make a Lion install stick and I was unable to restore InstallESD.dmg to a 4 GB USB stick but of course the reason that wouldn't fit is there was slightly more than 4 GB of data.
The rich get richer and the poor get poorer eh? Or is it the rich think different and play by a different set of rules? Do the rich take responsibility and action? Poor people believe 'Life happens to me.' Rich people are committed to be rich. Poor people WANT to be rich. Rich people think big. Poor people think small. Rich people focus on opportunities. Poor people focus on obstacles. Rich people are willing to promote themselves and their value. Poor people think negatively about selling and promotion. Poor people are closed to new ideas.. Do You think rich or poor?

UNStudio has joined forces with HPP Architects to create a consortium (UNS + HPP) to carry out the next phases of their winning project at the architectural design competition for FOUR Frankfurt. Take a look at the complete story after the jump. From the architects: The centrally located 16,000 square meter site was purchased by Groß & Partner real estate development company – who will be carrying out the development of the project – back in 2015. Situated in the very core of the city, the site has been completely inaccessible for the last 45 years. Now four new high-rise towers will change Frankfurt’s skyline from the air, while cultivating its liveliness on the ground. The development of these towers, reaching heights of 228 meters, will open up new streets to create a multi-use, vibrant inner-city quarter, bringing together a healthy mix of work, living, relaxation and recreation. The choice of programmes allows for a smooth transition from Frankfurt’s shopping district to the east of Roßmarkt, to the high-rise office towers clustered around Park Taunusanlage. With a development concept that is unique to Europe, the FOUR Frankfurt project brings together facilities that will establish a lively new neighbourhood for Frankfurt, its visitors, and its (future) residents. The new high-rise complex will be integrated into the expanding city structure by incorporating the heritage-listed facades of the Junghofstraße into the design and by making a multi-storey base building the connecting element of the entire site. According to the assessment by the competition jury, the unique quality of the quarter can be found in its public development and amenity value. The new development will therefore create connected spaces, accessible rooftops, pathways and passages. The existing block on the Junghofstraße will be opened up to strengthen the surrounding pathways and ensure a high level of accessibility. This will create a multi-use, diverse quarter comprising 50% office spaces, 30% living accommodation (including subsidized housing), in addition to retail spaces, restaurants and hotels. Four Frankfurt is expected to be completed in 2023.

Sellers who are non-residents (eg. foreigners living abroad and Japanese citizens living abroad). Buyers, both local and overseas residents, who are buying real estate in Japan from a non-resident. If the seller of Japanese real estate is a non-resident, depending on the situation, the buyer must withhold 10.21% of the sale price and pay it to the tax office, with the remaining 89.79% paid to the seller. The buyer is responsible for paying the 10.21% to the tax office by the 10th of the month following the transaction. It is your obligation to make this payment to the tax office by the deadline. If you are currently living overseas, you will need to appoint a tax representative or accountant to pay this on your behalf. You will need to appoint a tax representative in Japan to file a final tax return to have the remainder returned to you (less any taxes that may have been owed). *If the payment of deposits and mid-term payments also meet the conditions for withholding tax, the tax must be withheld and paid by the buyer at each payment. The above information has been provided as a general guide only. For more details on this tax, and for other detailed tax questions, please consult with the tax office or a specialist tax accountant.

Educating women, in particular, has unmatched transformative power. It not only empowers them but also has a positive effect on their family and surroundings. Women with more education tend to have fewer children, which benefits them, their families and the society at large. Education is also one of the most powerful elements of improving people’s health. It saves the lives of millions of mothers and children, helps prevent diseases, and is an essential component of efforts to reduce malnutrition. Educated mothers are better informed about diseases; therefore, they take preventative measures, recognize signs of illness early and tend to use health care services more often. To create awareness regarding the importance of girl child eductaion, SOC Films in collaboration with Chime of Change, created a series of short documentaries on young girls who want to achieve their dreams and aspirations to seek excellence in various professions in future whether it's sports, literature, science, math, activism, or so on and so forth. Chime for Change, a global movement is aimed at strengthening voices speaking out to support the cause of promoting justice, health and education for girls and women the world over. These documentaries were screened at an event in New York on 11th October this year, which is also celebrated as the International Day of the Girl Child. The event was also featured in Huffington Post. Areeba Fatima, a student of Dawood Public School, one of the biggest girls’ school in Karachi, is also featured in one of the documentaries where she expresses her desire to become a diplomat to be able to represent Pakistan at the UN and paint a positive picture of the country. The documentary can be viewed here: http://vimeo.com/107582646 . Dawood Public School is among the very few schools that aim to empower women by giving them the confidence of facing the world through participation in many extracurricular activities including sports, debates, performing arts etc.

When it comes to divorce in Salt Lake City, each party has a lot to lose–especially if you have children or significant assets. One of the most complex issues is the division of assets and property. Utah law requires the distribution to be equitable. In many divorce cases, both parties are unable to agree how to divide property and assets. It can often create an acrimonious situation. An experienced and knowledgeable Salt Lake City divorce lawyer can often make the difference between getting the settlement you deserve to losing everything you have rightfully earned. In most Utah divorces, there are three major assets that are usually involved–the home, personal property and retirement plans/investments. Here is a brief rundown on how Utah courts determine equitable asset and property division. Home & Property: Many of the most heated divorce cases in Salt Lake City involve which party is entitled to receive the home. The court can use several different methods of determination. Here are the most common depending on the circumstances of each case. First, the court may order the house to be sold and equity divided among the two parties. The court may also allow one party to buy out the other person’s interest in the real property. Another common ruling is to have the property awarded to one party and the remaining assets of equal value given to the other. Personal Property: Personal property is classified as the ownership of any material possessions that can be moved. It includes cars, furniture, and clothing. While most people do not share clothes, the determination of vehicles and furniture can sometimes become complex–especially if they are co-owned by each party. Utah courts place a priority on dividing personal property equitably. Retirement Plans & Investments: The division of retirement and investment accounts can sometimes get complicated under Utah family law. If only one party has a pension or retirement plan, in most cases the other party is entitled to half of the amount earned during the time of the marriage. Any money earned before the marriage will not be divided. If both parties have their names on investment or retirement plans, the court can rule either two ways. Both individuals can retain the full value of their own plans or the court will order an equitable distribution of all accounts. In a perfect world, divorcing couples can agree to divide assets and property on their own. Unfortunately, that is not always the case. But there are some solutions to come up with a reasonable agreement. One viable option is mediation. Many Salt Lake City divorce attorneys offer mediation services to help couples find common ground on some of the most difficult family law issues. Under Utah family law, both parties are required to undergo at least one mediation session to attempt to resolve their differences. A mediator is an independent arbitrator who can listen to both sides explain their issues and concerns. It is often a less stressful alternative to court is also far less expensive than going through the conventional divorce process. To learn more about your options concerning the division of assets and property, contact Salt Lake City divorce attorney Emy A. Cordano for a consultation today.
BELIEVE IT OR NOT... WE WORK FOR THE CITY -- ERASING GRAFFITIS. We are a company created by Professional Tour Guide/ Sommelier/Graff Artist/ Local Tattooed Street Thug* Al Ramirez, founder of Al Ramirez Wine Tours / Valparaiso Wine Tours, who arrived back to Valpo from NYC in '06. VSA tours was co-founded by Jekse and Cines, a couple of local graffiti artists who are doing some great things lately, helping Valparaiso become one of South America's most painted town... the guys can't stop painting! they go by "La UKD Crew"; they been painting graffiti and tagging South America since they can remember. Why? ask them when you meet them! Our guides are "Perf" Amboy Chris, Seba, Diego "Pes", all experts in local graffiti and street art. They're in charge of making sure you have a great experience. Al Ramirez AKA "MR. Al RAMIREZ" at Work! He also paints (not great, but don't tell him that). He likes to walk around like he's the boss because he "created the Idea", "The first ever Street Art Tour Guide in Chile", and "everyone copies him"... but no one here is trying to hear it. If he gives you a tour, act like you liked it (nod and chuckle, while looking away)... then come back and take a real tour with the other guides. A comedian once said "this world we live in is unbelieveable! I went in to rob a liquor store and when I came out someone had stolen my car!" That car thief could very well be Jake1 (see the pic/evidence above). He's the type of person who would boil a Frappucino/Iced Coffee just to rebel against the system. We've seen him go into a vegan restaurant, and ask for a lamb chop. Come on, Joaquin. This needs to stop. This is El Seba or Sebastian. Just look at the picture and the bio will speak for itself. He is the one who gets yelled at the most at the office, and asks waaaay too many questions. We dislike him. Very much. He's the type of person who will be telling a story, such as, "So, I told the stupid police officer not to dare talk to me like that", and the police officer will be standing behind him without him knowing it. Then he'll spend the night in jail, and come out the next morning only to pee in the street and get thrown back in within minutes. Eddie is a comic book nerd, and a lover of Japanese culture. He is also a graff writer who goes under the name Rone, which comes from "Ronin" -- we looked up the word and it means Wanderer... and that's exactly where his mind is, wandering away from this planet. Don't be surprised if he starts talking about R2 D2 on the tour. Nerd. "UnKolorDistinto" as they are known around the globe, are a couple that paint together (all day, every day). - No, they are not siamese twins. - If you sit and listen to one of their mixtapes, you'll most likely fall asleep. - They work as workshop tour instructors here and there. El Pollo is our Hype Man. He's in charge of putting our flyers in your hotel or hostel or B&B, etc. El Pollo is a specialist. At the tender age of 36 (He looks young because he eats tons of garlic), El Pollo sold his entire school raffle tickets, and he won all of the prizes! We'll keep him around for a long time. Unknown Real Name AKA "Mr. Molly & Sally" Mr. M&S is a criminal... a thug who mugged one of our guides, and now works for us (Yes, he mugged a job from someone). He doesn't speak english, but he understands it from his travels through Ritoque, where everyone says "Sorry, Hermano" instead of "Disculpa, Bro" or "Esto es super cool" instad of "oh que piola la wax"... so when we tried to talk smack about him he understood us, and mugged us all. Anyway, now he's our guide in Spanish. Does the tours on Saturday, and when he feels like it on Sunday. He always shows up late or last minute. THANK YOU. You all make this possible.
The Hawaii man who was fired after issuing the false ballistic missile alert in mid-January told reporters Friday that he was very upset over the incident but remained adamant that it appeared, at the time, to be a real-life attack. The former state employee – a man in his 50s who asked to remain anonymous for his safety – said that he was “100 percent sure” that the drill on Jan. 13 was real, even though several other employees heard the word “exercise” repeated throughout the message, according to officials. Once the man realized what had happened, he said he felt like he’d sustained a “body blow.” Since then, he’s reportedly been distressed to the point that he has had trouble eating and sleeping. During a news conference on Tuesday, investigating officer Brig. Gen. Bruce Oliveira shared details of the state’s probe and said when the mistake was realized, the employee “froze” and “seemed confused.” Another employee had to resume his duties and send a correction message, Oliveira said. The employee also reportedly had at least two previous incidents in which he mistook drills for real-world events, including for tsunami and fire warnings. But Oliveira said the employee was previously counseled and allowed to resume his duties. Following the event, the employee was fired and Vern Miyagi, who oversaw the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency, took responsibility and resigned. Toby Clairmont, the agency’s executive officer, also resigned before disciplinary action could be taken, and authorities are in the process of suspending another worker without pay. By 8:20 a.m., Hawaii EMA tweeted there was “NO missile threat” to the state, but failed to send a phone alert for another 38 minutes, causing mass panic among people who weren’t able to check social media.
Shania Twain expected to break the charts with new album NOW! Even after a 15-year hiatus, she’s still the one! Shania Twain is on pace to top the charts with her new album NOW. The 16-song LP was released on Sept. 29 and is set to shoot past Demi Lovato and Miley Cyrus to claim the number one spot on Billboard’s Top 200. The Timmins native hopped on Twitter on Wednesday to announce that her album is already platinum in Canada! Shortly after the release of the lead single “Life’s About to Get Good,” it hit number one on the Billboard 200. Of course, fans were simply dying to see how their favourite country icon was doing, so the new single rocked its way to the top of Billboard + Twitter Trending 140, too! So far, the song’s video has over four million views on YouTube and the number continues to ride the wave of Now’s release. The 52-year-old country star, still clad in her iconic leopard print, insists that Now is not a break up album but another coming-of-age collection of tunes bound to make listeners laugh, cry and rock out. This is one country powerhouse that just doesn’t quit. Despite originally declaring her 2015 Rock This Country tour as her final encore, Shania is ready to hit the road again. “I look forward to everyone getting familiar with the album – and then getting out there and performing live!” she exclaimed to Hello!. The Shania Now tour kicks off on May 3 in Tacoma, Washington, and will see the singer make stops in Vancouver, Toronto, Montreal, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Saskatoon, Hamilton, Ottawa, London and Quebec City. Tickets to see the Canadian musician are on sale now.
George Wales visits The Good Earth Chinese Restaurant in Wandsworth Common. Situated next to the picturesque expanse of Wandsworth Common, Bellevue Road is already well known to those of a foodie inclination, having been home to Michelin-starred French restaurant Chez Bruce for the best part of 20 years. However, it would seem that Bruce Poole’s celebrated brasserie is not the only gastro-string to the area’s bow, with newcomer The Good Earth serving up excellent Chinese food just two minutes up the road. A family-run establishment, it is the latest opening in a group of London-based eateries under the Good Earth banner, with another restaurant in Knightsbridge and a number of take-away outlets dotted around South West London. However, this is a significant cut above your average chain restaurant. Having been seated in a sleek, modern dining room, all polished wood and crisp white tablecloths, we opted for two set dinners, assured by the helpful Maître D’ that the fixed price menu was made up of the restaurant’s finest dishes. A selection of starters was dominated by a pair of eye-catching Dragon’s Whisker Prawns, succulent king prawns encased in a cocoon of fine shredded pastry. Another highlight was a portion of Honey-Glazed Ribs, a sticky treat, the meat falling pleasingly away from the bone. Next up was that traditional takeaway staple, Aromatic Duck, served with the obligatory pancakes, hoisin sauce and spring onions. Done well, it’s a thing of beauty, and happily, The Good Earth does it very well indeed, the duck beautifully tender, its skin crisp and tacky. Delicious. Finally, the mains. Chicken with Cashew nuts was another traditional dish done well, but Fillet of Beef in Claypot was the star performer, arriving still sizzling at the table, the flavour of the meat more than living up to the spectacle. At just under £40 per person, without wine, this Chinese banquet comes in a shade more expensive than your typical neighbourhood restaurant, but given the quality (and quantity) of the food on offer, it’s well worth the extra outlay. If you are looking for another reason to check out the area, visit The Ship pub in Wandsworth, which is ideal for summer drinks on the large terrace.

I met with Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson to discuss the Administration’s ongoing reforms to the national security space enterprise. The 5th Congressional District of Colorado is the epicenter of national defense space, and I had a productive conversation on everything Colorado Springs has to offer, including coming decisions on topics such as where U.S. Space Command will be located. I was honored to have met the brave Navy Seal who killed Osama Bin Laden. I’m thankful for his service and sacrifice to our country. On March 23rd I had the privilege of presenting awards to the winners of the Congressional Art Competition here in the Fifth District. I've been amazed at the great artistic talents of the young people in the Colorado Fifth Congressional District over the years of judging the competition. This gives me the chance to meet the best and brightest young men and women of the District. This year we recognized the teachers of the students, as they're the primary shapers of our young people's artistic talent. The art competition provides us with a wonderful opportunity to showcase the abilities of our District's brilliant young artists to the rest of the nation. Once the winners have been selected by a local panel of professional artists, the Grand Prize winner's art displayed in the United States Capitol Building for one year. It's always a joy to walk by the artwork of our young students and admire their hard work and artistic ability I look forward to seeing the work of this year's winner displayed alongside that of other brilliant young artists from across America. I was honored to receive the True Blue Award from the Family Research Council. Consistently voting pro-life and pro-family is important to me. Rep. Lamborn rallied for Jack Phillips today while the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission case. Jack doesn’t violate any proper understanding of nondiscrimination laws. He serves all people, but declines some requests for custom cakes that conflict with his faith. That is not a form of unlawful discrimination, but a legitimate exercise of his artistic and religious freedom. Rep. Lamborn and Rep. Lee Zeldin (NY-01) join Stuart and Robbi Force, the parents of Taylor Force, whom H.R. 1165 was named for after his murder by Palestinian Authority funded terrorism. The Palestinian Authority allocates hundreds of millions of dollars annually to pay terrorists to murder innocent Israelis and Americans. The bill is an important first step in ending U.S. tax dollars from supporting terrorists who kill innocents like Taylor. After nearly two years, the Mueller report is now available to the public, and it shows NO collusion between the Trump Campaign and Russia. It is time to move away from the false collusion allegations that stem from the Democrats and the media. I voted to make the report public because I believe the government should be transparent, and my constituents deserve to read the findings of the report. I hope this will finally end all of the partisan games so we may focus on our jobs, and continue with the legislative agenda to better our country. I applaud the Senate for confirming Colorado native David Bernhardt as the next Secretary of the Interior. I believe Bernhardt will continue to use his vast experience to remove burdensome federal regulations and advance policies that will benefit Colorado.
Marcelito Pomoy recently appeared at “The Ellen DeGeneres Show.” He is the latest Filipino to guest in this popular talk show. He was interviewed first by Ellen and an interpreter helped Marcelino answer the questions. Marcelito said that at h didn’t immediately believe that he got an invite from the show and initially thought that it was a spam email. Even after he had a Skype call with a representative of the show he still had doubts. It was not until his ticket was emailed to him that he finally got convinced that it was real! The Kapamilya singer and Ellen talked about Marcelito’s humble beginnings. According to Marcelito, he started to sing at early age of seven and learned that he had this gift to switch voices at the age of eighteen. Ellen also asked Marcelito about his experience living in the streets and finally ending up as winner at the 2012 Pilipinas Got Talent.

President Donald Trump returned to Washington, DC on Monday for a very important event. It was not for a meeting with an international leader. And it was not for a joint session of Congress. No, on this day, Trump greeted thousands of children. They had come to the White House for the annual Easter Egg Roll. The event has been a U.S. tradition for more than a century. In the late 1800s, local children gathered on the hill beside the president’s house to play a game with their colored eggs following the Easter holiday. The White House Easter Egg Roll was of special interest this year. The Trump administration was very late to organize it. Some people who hoped to attend the event were even worried that it would be canceled. Political observers said the Easter Egg Roll would show how well Trump’s administration could plan and operate a complex public relations event. Talk about the event also brought attention to the first lady, whose office usually plans the White House Easter Egg Roll. First Lady Melania Trump has not yet moved to Washington, DC. She says she will remain in New York City until her son finishes the school year. So, how did the White House Easter Egg Roll go this year? Just fine, early reports say. About 21,000 children and their families received tickets to this year’s event. They came in small groups to the lawn near the president’s house. They played soccer, tossed bean bags and, of course, pushed hard-boiled eggs down the hill. The event was smaller than in previous years. Last year, for example, about 36,000 people attended. This year’s Easter Egg Roll also did not include performances by top celebrities or professional athletes. Instead, children were invited to draw pictures for U.S. soldiers. The Easter Bunny made an appearance, though, as did both Trump and the first lady. They were there with their 11-year-old son, Barron. The president welcomed his young guests and promised them that the nation was getting stronger, bigger, and better. Kelly Jean Kelly wrote this story for Learning English.

ST. JOHNS COUNTY, Fla. - Commissioners in St. Johns County voted unanimously to postpone any legislative action against a localized ban of a substance that the DEA has classified as a "drug of concern." According to a report by the St. Augustine Record, 19 speakers during a Tuesday night commission meeting defended their right to use kratom, speaking about the health benefits they'd recieved while battling fibromyalgia and anxiety. Commissioners agreed to table any action until at least May, after the Legislative session. ORIGINAL STORY: Could drug with opioid-like properties be banned in St. Johns County? The FDA has warned people against using kratom, saying it has properties similar to those of opioids. It's legal in the U.S. aside from Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Tennessee, Vermont, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia. There are no restrictions on kratom in Florida, expect in Sarasota County, where it's banned.
The NHS is still running Windows XP en masse, two and a half years after Microsoft stopped delivering bug fixes and security updates. Nearly all of England NHS trusts – 90 per cent – continue to rely on PCs installed with Microsoft’s 15-year-old desktop operating system. Just over half are still unsure as to when they will move to a replacement operating system. Fourteen per cent reckoned they’d move to a new operating system by the end of this year, and 29 per cent reckoned the move would happen “some time” in 2017. Windows XP is not receiving any security updates from Microsoft, meaning health service PCs are wide open to hackers and malware. The data on the NHS' use of Windows XP comes courtesy of a Freedom of Information request from Citrix, which approached 63 NHS trusts and received responses from 42. An FoI request from Citrix made in July 2014, three months after Microsoft’s deadline to move off Windows XP, had found 100 per cent of NHS trusts were dependent on the operating system. The Reg first reported in early 2014 how vast sections of the UK public sector was set to miss Microsoft’s April 2014 kill date for XP. The government had agreed a temporary framework support agreement with Microsoft which guaranteed delivery of special security patches for a year. That agreement ended on April 14 2015 after it was decided not to go for a second year.
Elvis Costello played a two-hour, 25-song show that touched on phases throughout his career, both deep cuts and hits, as well as nine of the new disc’s 12 songs. And to the delight of the nearly sold-out crowd, Costello did them all them well. Over a career of more than 40 years, singer Elvis Costello has been a punk provocateur, a seminal new wave voice, a contemporary pop singer and even a classic crooner. And there have been fans of each of Costello’s career ventures. So how to satisfy everyone coming to see Costello kick off the North American leg of his latest tour at Sands Bethlehem Event Center to support yet another venture – his very strong new disc “Look Now”? On Friday, Costello did his best to do just that, playing a two-hour, 25-song show that touched on phases throughout his career, both deep cuts and hits, as well as nine of the new disc’s 12 songs. And to the delight of the nearly sold-out crowd, Costello did them all well – not afraid to revisit not only the songs of his earlier career, but also carrying the spirit of them into the newer songs. Perhaps after surviving cancer surgery that canceled the end of his European leg, the 64-year-old Costello was emboldened, or re-invigorated. Either way, his performance, and voice, was stronger than when he played the Sands in 2016. Backed by a crack three-man band and two female singers, Costello opened the show with “This Year’s Girl” from his 1978 sophomore disc, “This Year’s Model,” with its swirling synth reviving that new wave sound. He followed that with two 1980s deeper cuts: a forceful “Honey, Are You Straight or Are You Blind,” and “Clubland,” with Costello’s ‘70s rocking edge. On the latter, Costello even held a finger to his nose to hush the crowd as he played a scrubbing lead and sang with a “Watching the Detectives” affect. Later offerings from the new disc were even better. The disc’s new single “Under Lime” had very much that 1977 vibe that ushered in new wave. “Why Won’t Heaven Help Me” was pretty rocking. The slow guitar-and-piano “Stripping Paper” was a clear reminder or the Elvis of old, and the slow, sensitive “Suspect My Tears” had some of his best vocals of the night, as he reached for a falsetto. Early in the show, the older songs Costello played were nearly all deeper cuts: “New Lace Sleeves” from 1981’s “Trust”; a rocking, new-wavey “(I Don’t Want to Go To) Chelsea,” with good lead guitar. So that when he did play a hit – his 1977 U.S. breakthrough “Watching the Detectives,” (in the same darkened-stage presentation as the last time he was at the Sands) it got a huge crowd reaction – and deservedly so. Costello later did the same with later songs: A largely voice-and-acoustic guitar version of 1986’s “Indoor Fireworks” to a big cheer from the crowd, and closed the main set with a faster, more rocking “Can You Hear Me” from his last disc, 2013’s “Wise Up Ghost” that segued right into the hit “Pump It Up,” thumping, urgent and rocking. Costello’s encore stretched eight songs and 40 minutes. It opened with one of the night’s best: a barely instrumented, mostly a cappella “Allison,” with his two female backup singers. It got a huge cheer. Then a stark and spare, piano-and-voice “Accidents Will Happen,” on which he reached for a high and powerful end note. He used that same vocal approach on “I Still Have That Other Girl,” which he also wrote with Bacharach, – really singing it --and paired that with a new Bacharach co-write, “He’s Given Me Things,” from the new disc. Costello flubbed the start of that song slightly, and after saying “this is the first night,” re-started it dramatically better. He followed that with another early deeper cut, “Green Shirt,” which started stripped, then built as the crowd clapped along. And then a six-minute version of his 1979 hit “(What’s So Funny ‘Bout) Peace Love and Understanding,” with a wonderful chorus coda. That completed Costello’s journey of giving everyone what they wanted. The fact that he could do that, and do it as well as he did, shows how important Costello’s music has been, and how much he still has left.
BAGHDAD, Iraq -- Fighting in the Shiite stronghold of Sadr City killed 23 Iraqis yesterday, hospital officials said, and the U.S. military reported five troop deaths, as April showed signs of becoming the worst month for U.S. forces in Iraq since September. At least 11 of the Iraqi deaths occurred when mortar shells landed in residential neighborhoods. Men rushed wounded children to overcrowded emergency rooms in Sadr City hospitals, on foot because of a ban on all vehicular traffic. In some parts of Sadr City, masked militiamen bearing machine guns and grenade launchers remained on the streets. Officials at local hospitals have put the death toll in the neighborhood at more than 70 since Sunday, but it was not clear if those figures included militia fighters. Thousands of Sadr City residents have fled for other neighborhoods. Prices in local markets were soaring as supplies dwindled, a result of suppliers' inability to bring in goods. Iraqi and U.S. forces appeared to be penetrating deeper into the neighborhood, one local journalist said. There were no signs that Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki was pulling back on his offensive against Shiite militias, which has sparked fighting between Iraqi and U.S. forces and militiamen loyal to Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr. Al-Maliki's deadline for fighters to hand in heavy weapons expired Tuesday, but the latest clashes showed that rocket-propelled grenades, mortars, and rockets remained in militia hands. Baghdad had spent part of yesterday quieter than in recent days, because of a curfew imposed to prevent clashes and protests marking the anniversary of the fall of Saddam Hussein on April 9, 2003. Al-Sadr had called for a huge march in Baghdad to mark the anniversary of Hussein's ouster and to protest the U.S. presence and al-Maliki's offensive. The cleric says the offensive, which began March 25 in the southern city of Basra, is targeting his Mahdi Army and is a ploy to cripple his political movement in advance of provincial elections planned for October. His fighters have risen up against Iraqi and U.S. forces, virtually collapsing a cease-fire that al-Sadr announced last August and that was credited with bringing a sharp drop in violence nationwide. Although U.S. and Iraqi officials maintain that they are targeting criminal elements or "special groups" that did not abide by al-Sadr's truce, U.S. Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker acknowledged yesterday that the Basra offensive had drawn in others. "A dangerous development in the immediate wake of the Basra operation was what appeared to be a reunification between special groups and JAM," he told lawmakers in Washington, using the acronym for al-Sadr's militia. Crocker and Gen. David Petraeus, commander of U.S. forces in Iraq, gave lawmakers their assessments of the war during two days of hearings in Washington that ended yesterday. The surge in troop deaths since the Basra offensive has underscored their contention that security gains witnessed in recent months easily could be reversed. At least 30 U.S. troops have died in Iraq since the Basra operation began, most in Baghdad; at least 19 have died in Iraq so far this month, representing the highest daily average since last September. The deaths announced yesterday brought to at least 4,031 the number of U.S. troops to die in Iraq since the war began in March 2003. Brief military statements said three of the soldiers died in roadside bomb blasts: two in northeastern Baghdad and one east of the city. Two others died of "non-combat" injuries, statements said, giving no other details.
Are stoners now a target advertising demographic for fast food companies? Ever since Harold and Kumar went to White Castle, fast-food companies have become increasingly blatant about targeting to stoners in their advertisements. July 31, 2012, 1:48 a.m. Between Taco Bell's "Fourthmeal" advertisements and Jack in the Box commercials featuring slow-talking stoners, it's hardly a secret anymore that fast-food companies are shamelessly targeting potheads with their ads. But have they crossed a line? Once considered a taboo marketing approach, the fast-food industry today appears to have brazenly embraced the late-night munchies, according to The Fix. Although advertisements never blatantly refer to pot smoking, subliminal messaging has become more obvious. Take, for instance, this recent Jack in the Box advertisement. And Taco Bell has created a jingle to go with its latest string of advertisements, which sings of the "late-night munchies." Of course, drive-thru windows open well into the morning hours also cater to the average midnight snacker, but there's little denying who the real target is given the choice of terminology. "If you're targeting that heavy fast-food user, you need to speak their language," said Denise Yohn, a brand consultant who's worked with restaurants for 25 years, to The Fix. "One way to do that is to talk about partying and munchies. To the mainstream audience it may just sound like late nights and drinking, but to a certain audience they're talking about getting stoned." It's not the same thing as flagrantly endorsing the use of marijuana, of course. But the fast-food industry no longer appears to think the pothead subculture is off limits either. Perhaps they're just embracing a market force, but the strategy also runs perilously close to catering directly to a drug-induced appetite that drives people to consume their product. Of course, this wouldn't be the first time that the fast-food industry was accused of catering to addiction. Not only has fast food been proven to be highly addictive, but the industry actually hires scientists to design its food for exactly that purpose. Whether marketing to stoners crosses an ethical line or not, it certainly seems to be working. Taco Bell has seen its sales spike by 6 percent since launching its "late-night munchies" advertisements. The marketing has been so successful that at least one new upstart fast-food enterprise has decided to sell its line of frozen burritos directly to potheads. Drive-thrus of nearly every major fast-food chain now typically stay open past midnight, undoubtedly due to a steady profit margin. So long as it works, it's not likely to change. In fact, without any backlash, it may not be long before advertisers compete explicitly for the stoner demographic. "A lot of companies are skipping the innuendo," said Yohn. "They think it's more effective to be overt. It creates more buzz. I think that's why you see a lot of advertising that seems unapologetically targeted to pot smokers." Ever since Harold and Kumar went to White Castle, fast food companies seem increasingly blatant about targeting to stoners in their advertisements.

Due to Hurricane Irene, parts of New Jersey were declared a federal disaster area this week. Federal funding is available to people in Bergen, Essex, Morris, Passaic, and Somerset Counties. More than 150,000 homes and businesses in the state remained without electricity Wednesday afternoon, with utilities predicting restoration by the weekend or early next week. The old Reading Viaduct, becoming a city park? Talks have been going on for eight years to get city officials on board with the idea. Now, the city is in talks with Reading International Co. to take control of the larger section of the viaduct to transform it into an elevated public park. Meanwhile, the Center City District is working with SEPTA on a legal agreement to create a park on the shorter section of the viaduct owned by the transit agency.

The latest report from Violence Policy Center. I find it ironic and sad that the very day an annual report on violence against women was released, a famed pro athlete was kicked off his team for slugging his wife in the face. By now you’ve probably heard that Ray Rice, the Baltimore Ravens star running back, was caught on camera hitting his then-fiance and knocking her out with the single blow in an elevator . The March incident cost him a two-game suspension, but when TMZ released the video showing the act, the Ravens terminated his contract and the NFL suspended him indefinitely. Today I captured the seriousness of domestic violence. The report from the Violence Policy Center shows that South Carolina is ranked the second worst state in the nation for violence against women. The report notes that 50 women were killed in 2012. Spartanburg County had four in 2012. The county has seen two husband-on-wife homicides so far this year and DV cases are some of the most common ones among daily incident reports here. Local leaders tell me it is a significant combination of problems that all need to be dealt with in order to change the status quo surrounding violence against women. Much of it starts with a serious culture change, they tell me. I was baffled when a colleague of mine pointed out the Fox News morning show “Fox & Friends.” The anchors on the program somehow find a way to joke about Ray Rice knocking out his now-wife and dragging her limp body out of the elevator. “I think the message is take the stairs,” one anchor quips. We got right to the point during an interview today with the victim services director at SAFE Homes, a domestic violence shelter and coalition in Spartanburg County. The gist of the interview was to hold people accountable for their actions and for society to never turn a blind eye. My full story on the violence against women ranking in South Carolina is at goupstate.com and in Tuesday’s Spartanburg Herald-Journal.

Of course, drive-thru windows open well into the morning hours also cater to the average midnight snacker, but there's little denying who the real target is given the choice of terminology. "If you're targeting that heavy fast-food user, you need to speak their language," said Denise Yohn, a brand consultant who's worked with restaurants for 25 years, to The Fix. "One way to do that is to talk about partying and munchies. To the mainstream audience it may just sound like late nights and drinking, but to a certain audience they're talking about getting stoned." It's not the same thing as flagrantly endorsing the use of marijuana, of course. But the fast-food industry no longer appears to think the pothead subculture is off limits either. Perhaps they're just embracing a market force, but the strategy also runs perilously close to catering directly to a drug-induced appetite that drives people to consume their product. Of course, this wouldn't be the first time that the fast-food industry was accused of catering to addiction. Not only has fast food been proven to be highly addictive, but the industry actually hires scientists to design its food for exactly that purpose. Whether marketing to stoners crosses an ethical line or not, it certainly seems to be working. Taco Bell has seen its sales spike by 6 percent since launching its "late-night munchies" advertisements. The marketing has been so successful that at least one new upstart fast-food enterprise has decided to sell its line of frozen burritos directly to potheads. Drive-thrus of nearly every major fast-food chain now typically stay open past midnight, undoubtedly due to a steady profit margin. So long as it works, it's not likely to change. In fact, without any backlash, it may not be long before advertisers compete explicitly for the stoner demographic. "A lot of companies are skipping the innuendo," said Yohn. "They think it's more effective to be overt. It creates more buzz. I think that's why you see a lot of advertising that seems unapologetically targeted to pot smokers." Ever since Harold and Kumar went to White Castle, fast food companies seem increasingly blatant about targeting to stoners in their advertisements.
A District Court decision overturning major provisions of three Executive Orders has been appealed. Here is a summary of the arguments made by Justice Department. Wednesday, December 5th, has been declared a day of mourning by President Trump. Most federal employees will be excused from work, including the Postal Service. On Wednesday, December 5th, the Federal Government will close in honor of America’s 41st president who died on Friday.
On April 4, 1975, Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded Microsoft. The small firm used to develop and sell BASIC interpreters. Little did they know that in the next 40 years, their company will become the biggest software firm in the world, and also bag the title for one of the most valuable companies. Today, there is a little bit of Microsoft in everybody’s life. Whether it is the desktop computer where Microsoft’s Windows has about 90 percent market share or the company’s Office which is unarguably the best productivity suite available. Maybe you are into gaming and own an Xbox One, or your company relies on Azure cloud services. In the last 40 years, Microsoft -- which once used to sell program language interpreters -- has expanded into several categories, and now makes full-fledged operating systems for not just desktop computers, but smartphones, gaming consoles, servers, as well as Internet of Things devices. Surface tablets and Xbox consoles show the company’s side interest in developing its own hardware modules. "Early on, Paul Allen and I set the goal of a computer on every desk and in every home. It was a bold idea and a lot of people thought we were out of our minds to imagine it was possible. It is amazing to think about how far computing has come since then, and we can all be proud of the role Microsoft played in that revolution", Gates wrote in an email sent to all Microsoft employees yesterday. "In the coming years, Microsoft has the opportunity to reach even more people and organizations around the world. Technology is still out of reach for many people, because it is complex or expensive, or they simply do not have access. So I hope you will think about what you can do to make the power of technology accessible to everyone, to connect people to each other, and make personal computing available everywhere even as the very notion of what a PC delivers makes its way into all devices", Gates noted. "Under Satya's leadership, Microsoft is better positioned than ever to lead these advances. We have the resources to drive and solve tough problems. We are engaged in every facet of modern computing and have the deepest commitment to research in the industry. In my role as technical advisor to Satya, I get to join product reviews and am impressed by the vision and talent I see. The result is evident in products like Cortana, Skype Translator, and HoloLens -- and those are just a few of the many innovations that are on the way". And this attitude was the reason Windows Phone 7 -- arguably Microsoft's first real take on a mobile operating system-- wasn’t released until 2010. By this time, iPhone had showed its dominance in the world, and Google was upping the ante with Android. Windows Phone is still struggling to gain any substantial market share. The mobile platform still has a wide "app-gap" problem, though the company seems to have found a couple of ways to fix it. But one of the most exciting things that happened in the company was its decision to open up. Under Nadella, Microsoft finally accepted that it doesn’t have a significant user base in smartphones. The company realized that if it didn't open up to rival platforms, it would miss out on a lot of users. And that’s one of the first things Nadella did after taking the charge of the company. Microsoft launched Office on iOS. Until then Office was only available on Windows, Windows RT, and Windows Phone, and a half-baked mobile version on Android. The move received an overwhelming response from users, resulting in Office apps -- Word, Excel and PowerPoint -- top the app chart in within 24 hours of their release on the platform. Late last year, the company made premium access to the Office suite free on iOS and Android. Office for iOS was in the works at Microsoft for a long time, but Ballmer used to prioritize its products on Windows devices first. Nadella evidently changed that. "We have accomplished a lot together during our first 40 years and empowered countless businesses and people to realize their full potential. But what matters most now is what we do next", Gates writes in his email. Microsoft does have a lot of things to look forward to in the coming months and years. Later this year, Microsoft will release Windows 10 for desktop computers, as well as smartphones, IoT devices and Xbox One. In the coming months, Microsoft will also release the next iteration of its productivity suite, Office 2016. For the first time, the company is simultaneously releasing Office on OS X and Windows. Additionally, Microsoft has showcased a number of products that could change the way we compute and interact with technology. Its augmented reality headset HoloLens is just one example. It will be interesting to see what the company does next and how things work out for it in the coming years.
The democratization of data is a real phenomenon, but building a sustainable data democracy means truly giving power to the people. The alternative is just a shift of power from traditional data analysts within IT departments to a new generation of data scientists and app developers. And this seems a lot more like a dictatorship than a democracy — a benevolent dictatorship, but a dictatorship nonetheless. These individuals and companies aren’t entirely bad, of course, and they’re actually necessary. Apps that help predict what we want to read, where we’ll want to go next or what songs we’ll like are certainly cool and even beneficial in their ability to automate and optimize certain aspects of our lives and jobs. In the corporate world, there will always be data experts who are smarter and trained in advanced techniques and who should be called upon to answer the toughest questions or tackle the thorniest problems.

As with similarly devised services — LinkedIn’s People You May Know, the gravitational search movement, or any type of service using an interest graph — the new feature’s beauty and utility lie in its abstraction of the underlying semantic algorithms and data processing. The problem, however, comes when we’re forced to rely on these people, features and applications to decide how data can affect our lives or jobs, or what questions we can answer using the troves of data now available to us. In a true data democracy, citizens must be empowered to make use of their own data as they see fit and they must only have to rely apps and experts by choice or when the task really requires an expert hand. At any rate, citizens must be informed enough to have a meaningful voice in bigger decisions about data. The good news is that there’s a whole new breed of startups trying to empower the data citizenry, whatever their role. Companies such as 0xdata, Precog and BigML are trying to make data science more accessible to everyday business users. There are next-generation business intelligence startups such as SiSense, Platfora and ClearStory rethinking how business analytics are done in an area of HTML5 and big data. And then there are companies such as Statwing, Infogram and Datahero (which will be in beta mode soon, by the way) trying to bring data analysis to the unwashed non-data-savvy masses. Combined with a growing number of publicly available data sets and data marketplaces, and more ways of collecting every possible kind of data — personal fitness, web analytics, energy consumption, you name it — these self-service tools can provide an invaluable service. In January, I highlighted how a number of them can work by using my own dietary and activity data, as well as publicly available gun-ownership data and even web-page text. But as I explained then, they’re still not always easy for laypeople to use, much less perfect. Statwing spells out statistics for laypeople. Can Tableau be data’s George Washington? This is why I’m so excited about Tableau’s forthcoming IPO. There are few companies that helped spur the democratization of data over the past few years more than Tableau. It has become the face of the next-generation business intelligence software thanks to its ease of use and focus on appealing visualization, and its free public software has found avid users even among relative data novices like myself. Tableau’s success and vision no doubt inspired a number of the companies I’ve already referenced. Assuming it begins its publicly traded life flush with capital, Tableau will not just be financially sound — it will also be in a position to help the burgeoning data democracy evolve into something that can last. More money means being able to develop more features that Tableau can use to bolster sales (and further empower business users with data analysis), which should mean the company can afford to also continually improve its free service and perhaps put premium versions in the hands of more types of more non-corporate professionals for free. Tableau is already easy (I made this) — but not easy enough. The bottom-up approach has already proven very effective in the worlds of cloud computing, software as a service and open-source software, and I have to assume it’s a win-win situation in analytics, too. Today’s free users will be tomorrow’s paying users once they get skilled enough to want to move onto bigger data sets and better features. But the base products have to be easy enough and useful enough to get started with, or companies will only have a lot of registrations and downloads but very few avid users. And if Tableau steps ups its game around data democratization, I have to assume it will up the ante for the company’s fellow large analytics vendors and even startups. A race to empower the lower classes on the data ladder would certainly be in stark contrast to the historical strategy of building ever-bigger, ever-more-advanced products targeting only the already-powerful data elite. That’s the kind of revolution I think we all can get behind. Feature image courtesy of Shutterstock user Tiago Jorge da Silva Estima. Great article Derrick – appreciating your work on the topic here on GigaOm. We’re seeing wider availability of reasonably priced BI and visualization software tools to help us understand that harnessing all this data is possible – and I think even consumers are beginning to understand the value of all the data, and the ability to make meaning from it. One part of the puzzle that’s missing from what I can see is the education – knowledge transfer of how individuals can use the tools, what good data science methods are, and how data citizens can actively contribute to the larger data analysis community. I see movements like the Open Data/Open Gov folks, and events like the NYC Big Apps hackathon as part of the solution – but as individuals, where do we go to take part? What is the role of an informed, curious citizen in this? More venues exist for learning some of the ‘how’ to make sense of big data as an individual taking a course online, but I’m not seeing a vision from anyone talking about how to connect all of the dots. To make sense of data, we need the tools, the practitioners, the analysis of the problems, but we also need a vision of how all of these will work. If anyone has ideas of who’s got that vision, I’d love to hear it. I feel one of the biggest impediments to the democratization of data is access. Most people know what they would like to answer, and how the data needs to be shaped to achieve that, but getting the data to do the actual analysis with can be one of the most difficult aspects. This is a bit of a plug, but we’re working on enabling data access that is easily attainable by everyone. Our platform http://www.quandl.com is a “search engine for data” that is able to fetch time series data from a disparate sets of sources, and provide it in a simple searchable form that allows users to extract, validate, format, merge, graph, and share it however they want. By providing the underlying data for analysis tools like Tableau, Statwing, and many others, we feel we can help to create the tool stack that empowers people to create a sustainable DIY data culture. In every company I’ve worked at, I’ve seen this major divide between IT analysts and Business users. Part of it was cultural, but a major reason was as you point out: “a historical strategy of building ever-bigger, ever-more-advanced products targeting only the already-powerful data elite”. The business user typically was left to use Excel to prepare and analyze data. It took 15+ years, but thanks to new players like Tableau, Spotfire and Qlikview which were sold primarily to the business user and focused on ease of use, the data democratization process has resulted in a power shift to the business user. Some IT departments have now come around and are trying to accommodate these “shadow IT” projects by providing IT support and giving Tableau users limited access to enterprise data stores. As for upping the ante for the traditional players, it has happened already. Over the last two years, the larger vendors have responded with products like Visual Insight (MicroStrategy), Visual Intelligence (SAP), PowerPivot (MicroSoft), JMP (SAS) etc. taking aim at this segment of the market. The Big Data market is still new, but the trend to build user-friendly (or at the very least, SQL-aware) tools on top of Hadoop is also hitting its stride. One good thing coming out of this data democratization is the realization that it has to be supported by a Data Governance effort. Otherwise we’ll see the unfortunate return of a major problem with data democracy: data chaos. Previously it would have meant comparing and reconciling two Excel spreadsheets, now we may end up reconciling the findings from two Tableau workbooks. Thanks for the comment, and for making a really good point about data governance. Obviously, that’s not too big a concern for personal data use, but competing findings from lots of disparate data sets would be problematic.

When Katherine Gotovsky sees a problem, her response is immediate. The gears in her 17-year-old mind start working away, determined to come up with a solution whether it’s at school, retirement residences or in the tech industry. She is one of six GTA students selected as Loran Scholars, an award which recognizes character, community contributions and future leadership potential. From a pool of more than 5,000 applicants, 34 young Canadians were selected for the award valued at $100,000 over four years. The honour includes an annual stipend of $10,000, matching tuition waiver and access to $10,000 in funding for summer internships. The other winners from the GTA are: Elektra Dakogiannis, Georgia Koep-Freifeld, Eden Wondmeneh, Lauren Prophet and John Milkovich. The selection of a Loran Scholar focuses on the young person’s character with the belief that integrity, courage, grit and personal autonomy are better indicators of overall potential than standard academic measures. Gotovsky, a University of Toronto Schools student, founded and leads a robotics team and the Girls in Tech conference. She teaches code to women and youth, plans initiatives for a national student organization and created her school’s foreign language newspaper. She established a companionship program at a retirement residence. Most of her endeavours began with her desire to solve a problem, she said. The Thornhill resident’s passion for solving problems began as a child when she would use her limited amount of Lego blocks to build elaborate and complex structures. Gotovsky now helps others solve their problems by teaching code to women and girls at Canada Learning Code, a digital skills program. Gotovsky plans on pursuing a degree in computer science at either McGill University or the University of Waterloo.
Ozier Muhammad/The New York TimesReynaldo Rodriguez of the Care Coordination program counseled a patient with H.I.V. on how to adhere to a drug regimen. Doctors are very good at telling us what to do — but we are very poor at doing it. In fact, the health problems of millions of Americans are directly related to our failure to follow doctors’ orders. Doctors tell us to take our pills, exercise, go get that C.T. scan, stop smoking, change our diets, cut out salt, quit drinking, monitor our blood sugar. We know we should do it, but we very often don’t. About three-quarters of patients do not keep appointments for follow-up care. In one study of diabetes patients, only 7 percent were compliant enough with their treatment plans to control the disease. Even people at grave and immediate risk do not always take their medicines: a quarter of kidney transplant patients in one study did not take their medicines correctly, putting them at risk for organ rejection. Among elderly patients with congestive heart failure, 15 percent of repeat hospitalizations were linked to failure to take prescribed medicines. And compliance with exercise and diet programs is even worse. Poor compliance is a major reason that sick people don’t get better, and that our health care costs are so high. It is a reason that often gets ignored. Many doctors are uncomfortable wrestling with adherence. They may even believe that it is not their problem, that their job is done when they write the prescription or hand the patient a diet plan. But even concerned doctors would find themselves helpless in a 10-minute office visit. They are too removed from their patients, too much the authority figure to really get to the bottom of why a patient isn’t doing what he is supposed to. Bad adherence doesn’t discriminate by social class. Tens of millions of Americans struggle with high cholesterol and blood pressure and yet can’t manage to stick to an exercise program. Far fewer — but far sicker and more expensive to the health care system — are the handful of emergency room frequent flyers: people with multiple serious conditions such as AIDS, diabetes, hypertension, depression, mental illness, social isolation, substance abuse or domestic violence. Such people have extraordinary problems sticking to their plans to get better, and need extraordinary help. Joe McManus is a 56-year-old former heroin and crack addict who lives in a single-resident-occupancy apartment in Manhattan. He spent 15 years as an addict, about 10 of them homeless. In some ways, he’s far from the typical homeless person. He used to work on Wall Street and still retains some of his Wall Street friends. In 2005, one of those friends took him to the Super Bowl. In other ways, he is absolutely typical of drug users who have hit bottom. McManus has AIDS, Hepatitis C and liver problems. “My doctors went three or four years with me not showing up,” he said in a recent interview in his apartment. “I had no relationship with her — except for her to put me in the hospital because I didn’t listen to what she had to say. I was still not addressing the fact that I was H.I.V.-positive. I was not taking my medicine and only going to the hospital when I had to be put in the hospital. I was still messing around with drugs.” McManus was hospitalized four times in the year before November, 2009. Then he got a visit from Reynaldo Rodriguez. When Rodriguez first visited McManus, he had already quit drugs, on his own. But he was still living as if he were homeless. His apartment was covered with soot and grime, the bed had cigarette burns and the refrigerator held moldy food. McManus was treating his apartment like it was the street. “How the hell are you living like this?” Rodriguez blurted out. It made a difference. McManus started taking his medicines. The medicines brought down his viral load — he was getting better, and that motivated him to take care of himself. McManus is thin and twitchy, but when I saw him was dressed in jeans and a nice zippered sweater, and the apartment was in reasonable condition. McManus is now 100 percent adherent to his medicines, and his hospital stays amounted to only a single night in the last 16 months. He said that part of it was a spiritual awakening, but it was clear that Rodriguez played a huge role. McManus now goes to all his doctor’s appointments on his own. But that doesn’t mean he follows all of his doctor’s advice. He’s no longer doing crack, but he’s still drinking — several nights a week he goes to hang out in a friend’s bar. He loves the bar — it’s his entire social network. But his Hepatitis C makes this dangerous behavior, and his doctor was stern: “You can not ever have a drink again. Not even on your birthday,” she told him. “I never have to tell you if I ever have one,” McManus thought to himself. Rodriguez and McManus worked out a compromise: he could keep going to the bar, but he had to tell his friends about his health problems so they would put the brakes on. He had to try to drink less, and keep doing tests that monitored his liver. “He’s been very honest with me,” Rodriguez said. Why more than with your doctor? I asked McManus. “She’s a doctor,” he said. The Care Coordination program, a city-wide initiative now in 28 sites in different hospitals around New York, was inspired and trained by a Boston-based program called PACT, for Prevention, Access to Care and Treatment. PACT is part of Partners in Health — a nongovernmental group famous for its work in Haiti, Rwanda and elsewhere. Part of Partners’ strategy is to use people from the community who are paid a stipend to visit patients, watch them take their pills and support them. Since 1995, PACT has been using these ideas in tough neighborhoods of Boston, first with H.I.V. patients and now with people with chronic diseases such as diabetes. The PACT project trains people from the community, some of whom have the same diseases and similar problems as their patients, to be community health workers. The new health reform law encourages pilot programs to try different forms of medical homes, and the better care and cost savings that come from improving adherence with peers or lay people like Rodriguez are attractive. The New Yorker magazine writer Atul Gawande recently profiled two clinics that use this model, in Atlantic City and Camden, N.J. There are successful programs that use nurses for outreach. The Nurse-Family Partnership sends nurses to visit low-income first-time mothers, beginning in pregnancy and continuing until the child is two. The program now operates in 32 states and has proven to greatly improve the life of both child and mother. The Camden program that Gawande wrote about also uses nurses and nurse practitioners to make home visits. But nurses are expensive home visitors, and they may not even be the best people for the job. “Given the rising cost of health care, we have found having peer-based health promoters providing care management is an equally effective way to provide high-quality care at a low cost,” said Ayesha Cammaerts, the director of operations at PACT. “Especially with patients who suffer from substance abuse and mental health issues, they need someone they feel comfortable letting into their environment. Sometimes patients don’t feel they can connect to clinicians from outside their community,” she said. PACT’s methods work. A study of AIDS patients found that the patients’ use of appropriate medicines rose — they were becoming adherent. At the same time, spending on hospitalization dropped by nearly two-thirds. Overall, patient costs dropped by 36 percent. Even taking into account the $6,000-per-patient cost of PACT, patient costs dropped 16 percent. And in a group of people who would likely have died if they had not been in the program, 70 showed clinical improvement. The PACT method is likely to be an important part of the future of American medicine. Many of the deficiencies of American health care require not more technology, but the human touch. It’s certainly true for high-risk, high-cost patients, but it can help nearly everyone get better health for less money. In Saturday’s column, I’ll write about how.
Hull - Where the US goes the UK often follows. This is especially true of negatives. If the US has extreme weather we usually experience similar a few days later. If violent crime increases across the Pond likewise in the UK. Then there is shopping madness. The UK is taking up traditional US activities such as Christmas shopping bargain days that leave customers with empty wallets and a range of unwanted goods. Black Friday has just passed and today is Cyber Monday. Each have become big shopping days on both sides of the Pond. Last Friday many people hit the shops attracted by huge price cuts and today the same is happening online. Is all as it seems though? As usual the answer is probably not. It is so easy to get sucked into spending unnecessarily. You buy in haste and repent at leisure. This year remember it is still in reality a consumer market. Businesses want your trade. That does not stop some of them throwing the odd rogue item into the pot. This year more than ever retailers will be trying hard to get you to part with your hard-earned money. There will be pre-Christmas sales and bargains long after today. With Christmas a few weeks away perhaps it would be wiser to hang fire. Shop around, be it online or on the High Street, take your time and purchase well. Bargains are sometimes far from that. They could be second-rate, last year's model or simply stock that is hard to shift. Once it is dressed up with a fancy cut-price sign you may find it hard to resist. Consider all the implications of your purchase before you buy. 1- If you buy online there may be delivery charges but you will be saving a potentially expensive trip to town which could be full of hassle. 2 - Emails dropping into your inbox, that offer great bargains, can be tempting. However, if you purchase an item you had no intention of buying is it really a bargain? Probably not, especially if money is tight. Having some idea of what you want to buy helps. If you shop "blind" you will be more likely to spend more than you should. Online retail oulets, just like the shops, are full of goods you never knew you wanted or needed and in many cases cannot afford. Cyber Monday also increases the temptation to buy now and pay later. Not a good idea. Pay for purchases online with a switch or debit card so you are not paying for Christmas well into the New Year or even beyond. One factor specific to the UK is that this week Chancellor George Osborne will announce to the country his Autumn statement, or Budget. It is doubtful that it will have a real positive effect on retail trade but it could. It could also cost you dearly in many ways. Brits take care and look after your money this cyber Monday. Perhaps the rest of you would be wise to follow suit too!

Following her acceptance into iPOP! after try-outs in Fort Walton Beach, Michelle Bryant is talking positively about her fast-approaching opportunity. In her mind, there are no ifs, ands or buts. She�s going. Period. However, to participate in the program, Michelle must raise about $5,000 � and she needs to do it fast. Michelle is signed with a New Orleans talent agency, which recently raised the possibility of her being cast as an extra in the HBO series �Treme.� However, the exposure budding performers receive at iPOP! reaches a wider audience, she said. Locally, Michelle has garnered some name recognition. She has appeared in several Crestview High School drama productions, most recently appearing in May in �The Sound of Music� as Marta, one of the singing von Trapp children. She�s appeared on the Pearl Tyner Auditorium stage in �Touchtone M for Murder,� �The 21st Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee� and �Seussical the Musical.� She hones her already impressive vocal talents as a member of the elite Destiny show choir of the Crestview High chorus. In October, she was voted the Bulldogs� Homecoming queen. In California, Michelle will do more than perform before an audience of casting directors, talent managers and theatrical agents. There are professional development and educational components to iPOP. The program gives participants a taste of the entertainment world, including auditioning before professionals responsible for casting films, commercials and television shows, and for populating fashion show runways, according to the iPOP! website. �Every performer auditions for qualified professionals who are currently working in the industry,� the iPOP website states. �Some will walk away with cash awards and scholarships and some will find success after the event in the acting, modeling and singing arenas.

Up to an inch of snow is likely on the Eastern Shore and up into Sussex County Friday afternoon. Below-freezing temperatures this week is leading to extra slippery roads Friday as snow falls across the Delmarva Peninsula. Multiple school districts and Sussex County government offices have closed early for the afternoon snow that is supposed to linger into the early evening, according to Eswar Iyer, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Wakefield, Virginia. "The heaviest snow should move east in the next couple hours and might not taper off until later afternoon and early evening," Iyer said just after 2 p.m. Accumulation totals have not changed from the morning prediction of 1 inch, but some areas could see a little more, Iyer said. Multiple vehicle crashes have been reported on the police scanner as roads have become icy, which is due to the cold temperatures leading up to Friday. "When it’s colder, the snow is able to stick to the roads quicker, and your roads are going to get slick quicker," Iyer said. The Ocean Police Police Department announced at 2:40 p.m. that westbound Route 90 lanes were closed because of a crash. It could take up to two hours to clear the crash. Maryland State Police is investigating. Rt. 90 is closed between Rt. 589 and Ocean Due to poor road conditions. Avoid the area. Salisbury Police tweeted they have nine active crashes under investigation as at around 3 p.m. "Snow catches us by surprise today and causes very icy road conditions," police said. "Slow down, use caution if you must be on the roadways this afternoon." Temperatures were forecasted to climb close to the freezing point for water in Salisbury, while Georgetown and Rehoboth Beach were only going to reach 28 degrees. It will be a little warmer in Ocean City and Accomac, with temperatures in the mid to upper 30s. The temperature won't drop significantly at night, with a low of 20 degrees in Salisbury, 18 degrees in Georgetown and 26 degrees in Accomac. Over the weekend, expect temperatures to rise into the 40s across Delmarva. By Monday or Tuesday, Delmarva residents can expect temperatures in the low 50s.
Jesse Winker will undergo season-ending shoulder surgery. He was batting .299 this year with 7 homers and 43 RBI. Throughout the last couple of seasons, Jesse Winker dealt with pain his right shoulder. After he felt more pain Monday, it was determined that Winker would need surgery to repair his shoulder. He will miss the remainder of the season. The Reds placed Winker on the 10-day disabled list Thursday with a right shoulder subluxation. "Man, I have no idea it is," said Winker. "I know my shoulder hurts. That’s all I know." Winker said the pain was "off and on" all season but Monday was essentially the final straw. On first base during a comeback win over the St. Louis Cardinals, Winker ducked under a line-drive single from Tucker Barnhart in the ninth inning and fell to the ground on the base paths. Winker later scored the game-winning run. A potential Rookie of the Year candidate, Winker was batting .299 this season with seven homers and 43 RBI. The outfielder ranked fourth in the Majors with a .405 on-base percentage. He had more walks (49) than strikeouts (46). Speaking to reporters Thursday, Winker was emotional about the end of his season. "Obviously, I was hoping that surgery wasn’t the end result but I’ve been dealing with this for 2-3 years," Winker said. "Just got to the point now where it’s time to go fix it." It's a tough loss for the Reds' lineup, which was already without outfielder Scott Schebler. On the DL, Schebler began a rehab assignment Wednesday, going 1-for-3 with a walk as a designated hitter at Triple-A Louisville. Winker, based on what he's been told from doctors, said his goal is to return by Feb. 1, 2019. He said he felt the pain when he completed "any baseball move." "There were times where it affected his swing," Reds interim manager Jim Riggleman said. "He altered his swing path because of the pain. That’s a tough way to play at the Major League level. He did a heck of a job. I don’t think anybody realized that he was going through it as much as he was." Mason Williams, an outfielder at Louisville, was called up to fill Winker’s roster spot. Williams played in 25 games with the New York Yankees over the past three seasons. A left-handed hitter, Williams signed with the Reds as a minor league free agent last offseason. Williams was batting .280 with six homers and 30 RBI in 87 games at Louisville. He recorded a hit in 13 of his last 14 games. "It’s been a matter of me being healthy and staying on the field and playing my game and just having confidence in myself," Williams said. Williams, once considered the Yankees' top prospect, learned of his promotion to the big leagues Thursday morning. He played on the same high school team in Florida as Cardinals pitcher Austin Gomber, who had a no-hitter against the Reds for six innings Tuesday. The two players will sometimes train together in the offseason. To make room on the 40-man roster for Williams, the Reds moved injured infielder Alex Blandino (torn ACL in his right knee) to the 60-day DL. "He’s had productive at-bats, competitive at-bats, against both left-and-right-handed pitching," Riggleman said of Williams. "He’s a good athlete. We’re confident he will come up here and do a good job." SCHEBLER STILL PROGRESSING: Schebler was in Louisville's lineup as a designated hitter for his second rehab game Thursday. But the key to his return will be when he's comfortable making throws.

Still image of Lisa Sharon Harper from YouTube. Pastors and lay leaders who represent minority and multiethnic communities and are appalled by the prospect of a Donald Trump presidency have a blunt message for the white evangelical majority that helped elect him: we’re disappointed in you, but not surprised. For these evangelicals of color, Trump’s use of racially-charged language, his anti-immigrant rhetoric, negative remarks targeting Mexicans and Muslims, as well as the emergence of the “Access Hollywood” tape and his other divisive comments about women, were simply disqualifying. While some prominent white evangelical leaders made their opposition to then-candidate Trump widely known (many signing a letter protesting his candidacy), the majority of white self-identified evangelicals (estimated to run as high as 81 percent), lined up behind him. “Many of [Trump’s] critics fell silent or fell into line, while the group known as the ‘religious right’ continued to support him’ says Kathy Khang, a Christian writer and speaker based in the Chicago area. For the past eight years, people of color, the LGBT community, and women have been given license to flourish, says Lisa Sharon Harper, author of The Very Good Gospel: How Everything Wrong Can Be Made Right and chief church engagement officer at Sojourners. “The white church demonstrated on November 8th that it is more white than Christian, and has a [greater] commitment to white supremacy than it does to Christ,” says Harper. The fact that so many evangelicals didn’t see Trump’s controversial rhetoric as derogatory underlined the presence of a persistent and troubling racial divide in American Christianity that these leaders say is deeply rooted in American history. Some are questioning the value of continued association with the white evangelical majority. Despite their dismay over the prospect of a Trump presidency, those I spoke to appear to be more motivated and energized than daunted by the challenges that lie ahead. “This has been a wakeup call to the progressive, moderate community that we have to stand up for what we believe in and communicate it in the public square,” DuBois concludes. And Lisa Sharon Harper tells me that “a new Civil Rights movement is happening, and its locus is in people of color.” She sees evidence of it already in the “movement for black lives,” the witness of the so-called “Dreamers” (undocumented immigrants who arrived here as children), and the rising call for solidarity with the poor that mirrors the words of Jesus in Matthew 25. “Every word of Scripture was written by oppressed people,” she says.

Boston Marathon Bombing Suspect Enters Not Guilty Pleas In 1st Public Court HearingFor the first plea, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev leaned toward a microphone and said, "Not guilty,'' in a Russian accent. He then said not guilty repeatedly about a half-dozen more times. Mayors Against Illegal Guns Apologizes For Calling Boston Bombing Suspect Victim Of Gun Violence The event is part of the gun-control group's 25-state "No More Names" tour, which is part of its campaign to build support for legislation to expand background checks for gun buyers. CBS News: Attack At Boston Marathon Was Supposed To Happen On July 4The official also said that Tsarnaev revealed that the bombs were constructed at his older brother Tamerlan's residence and that Tamerlan had brought Dzhokhar into the plot a couple of months before.

Maureen Hancock is an internationally renowned Spirit Medium, intuitive, teacher, lecturer, Holistic Healer, and author of the bestselling book, “The Medium Next Door: Adventures of a Real-Life Ghost Whisperer.” She is the star of the Style Network documentary, Psychic in Suburbia. Hancock has been interviewed by national television, radio, and print publications, including CNN, Associated Press, VH1, Martha Stewart Living magazine & radio, The Boston Globe, Coast-to-Coast radio, ABC, NBC, CBS, and FOX Television programs all over the country. She has spent decades demystifying the overwhelming subject matter of death, and helping individuals to flex their intuitive muscle, and tap into messages from spirit. Maureen’s work has brought comfort, hope and healing to the masses. She has taught workshops on intuition building to law enforcement, medical professionals, financial experts, and the “Average Joe.” She spends much of her time giving back by assisting those with terminal illness, sitting with newly bereaved parents, aiding law enforcement- including the FBI, and motivational speaking about life after death, stress management, intuition, and perspective building. Maureen was a reoccurring guest on the Ricki Lake Show, and recently filmed a Television pilot for a major network with the hopes of having a nationally syndicated talk show in the near future. She sent us her newest predictions for our readers to ponder. Trump will stay in office, despite Mueller’s thorough, and fact-filled investigation, proving beyond a shadow of a doubt that the President was involved in a number of illegal activities, including campaign finance violations, back deals with Russia, The Saudi Prince, and more. February is a volatile time politically. Trump will NOT be reelected. Multiple indictments will be issued within days of the end of his term. –Joe Biden will win the Democratic nomination for President. He will ask Beto O’Rourke to be his Vice President on the ticket. Joe Biden and Beto O’Rourke will be ever so close in the bid for the Democratic nomination. Joe Biden will win the nomination. Trump supporters will slide over to Biden with his “knock-him-out” old fashioned style tough talk. O’Rourke, with his Kennedy look-a-like persona will take the country by storm. However, his lackluster policy ideas, and not signing the bill for Social Security, as well as non-support of the bill for Medicare for All, will hurt him. Trump will go neck-and-neck with Romney for the Republican nomination. I feel Trump will win the nomination. I predict Joe Biden will be the next President of the United States. The stock market takes another serious dive in February around the 14/15th. March shows improvement as a new deal with China is reached. Stocks soar to an all-time high with the China trade deal by April 1st. The housing market: Mortgage rates will rise to 5.5% by June. Home prices will increase slowly, and inventory for new home buyers will go down. New construction will be at an all-time low by spring. June is peak time for the market to show these changes. This spring is a Seller’s market. The end of 2019 shows signs of a recession. Tensions remain high with Russia. March brings increased tensions with Putin due to a devastating military action in the Ukraine. North Korea launches a missile test around May/June, causing increased tensions with the US (South Korea & Japan). More troops will be deployed to Afghanistan by May/June due to increased tensions and military actions. Trump will pull troops out of Syria beginning in March, and by summer he will have to order troops back, in larger numbers, due to an overwhelming attack on the Kurds. –The winter will bring unexpected amounts of snow and Nor’easters to the whole East Coast, with the biggest surprise impact in February from Maryland to the Carolinas. Over 2 ft. of snow will fall on the Boston area around Feb. 6th, and the whole North East will be crippled by an even larger storm around Feb. 14/15th. June brings a trifecta to California. an Earthquake, 6.2 scale or greater, followed by mudslides, and devastating drought brings wildfires the end of June. A natural disaster in the form of an earthquake and volcano eruption for Italy around August. Prince Harry & Duchess Meghan will give birth to a baby girl, with an “A” name (like Amelia) the end of February/beginning of March (not late March April as announced). Prince Philip’s health declines significantly with a heavy gloomy feeling on November/December. Taylor Swift will announce her engagement to Joe Alwyn around April. Selena Gomez will undergo a serious medical procedure (possible stem cell transplant) by the summer. Miley Cyrus will announce her pregnancy in June. Jennifer Anniston adopts a baby by the fall. Brad & Angelina talk reconciliation come summer. Sofia Richie & Scott Disick announce their engagement this spring! Sofia will be pregnant by summer. Bill Cosby has renal failure in prison. He might not make it through the treatment. Venus Williams announces engagement to Nicholas Hammond by the summer. She will be pregnant soon after the quick wedding! What are the Top Five Action Games?
MADRID: As Cristiano Ronaldo enjoyed his time off at the French Riviera, his Portugal team-mates were busy handing Italy another disappointing result in the UEFA Nations League. Portugal did not need Ronaldo, who skipped international duty to recharge after a busy summer, to beat Italy 1-0 in Europe’s newest soccer competition. Elsewhere, Turkey mounted a remarkable comeback from two goals down against Sweden, while Kosovo made history with their first competitive win since being admitted to UEFA in 2016. The European champions easily outplayed Italy, which had opened its Nations League campaign with a disappointing 1-1 home draw against Poland in its first competitive match under coach Roberto Mancini. Andre Silva scored on a counterattack early in the second half to give Portugal the Group 3 win in the top-tier League A. The hosts had several chances to extend their lead at the Stadium of Light in Lisbon, while Italy created little and relied mostly on set pieces. The Nations League gives UEFA’s 55 member countries competitive games and eliminates friendlies. The winners of the League A groups featuring the highest-ranked countries go into a final-four competition in June. Santos did not call up Ronaldo after talking to the player and saying he needed more rest following the World Cup and his transfer from Real Madrid to Juventus. Ronaldo also didn’t play in the team’s 1-1 draw in a friendly against Croatia last week. Social media photos showed Ronaldo and his family enjoying time off in Monaco in recent days. It was Italy’s second competitive match since last year’s World Cup playoff loss to Sweden. Two goals five minutes apart early in the second half gave Kosovo a historic 2-0 win over the Faroe Islands in Group 3 of the fourth-tier League D. Kosovo, the Balkan republic which was accepted by UEFA and FIFA two years ago, had opened with a 0-0 draw at Azerbaijan. Turkey bounced back from an opening loss to Russia by coming from two goals down to defeat Sweden 3-2 thanks to two late goals by Emre Akbaba. Akbaba scored in the 88th minute and two minutes into stoppage time to give Turkey the League B victory. Sweden, making its Nations League debut following its surprising quarterfinal appearance at the World Cup, had taken a 2-0 lead by the 49th minute at Friends Arena in Stockholm. It was Turkey’s first away win in seven matches. In the third-tier League C, Scotland ended its run of three straight losses with a 2-0 win over Albania in Group 1. In Group 4, Serbia and Romania drew 2-2, while Montenegro defeated Lithuania 2-0. In League D, Andorra and Kazakhstan drew 1-1 in Group 1, while Malta drew with Azerbaijan 1-1 in Group 3. The Nations League guarantees at least one of Europe’s low-ranked League D teams will qualify for Euro 2020 through a playoffs.

The New York Times on Thursday printed a special section featuring portraits of nearly every member of the record number of female lawmakers in Congress. A viral Twitter thread from the Times’ design editor, Josh Crutchmer, includes a video of the covers the night before publication that has been viewed over 320,000 times as of Thursday morning. The photos, which were taken on Capitol Hill over five days by Times photographers Elizabeth D.

An Alsip police officer seriously wounded a man in an on-duty shooting early Wednesday after tracking a Cadillac suspected of being involved in drag racing into the Mount Greenwood neighborhood. The officer fired shots when the driver of the Cadillac, identified as a 25-year-old man, failed to follow police commands to raise his hands and drove toward the officer and his partner, Alsip Police Chief Jay Miller said in a statement released Wednesday afternoon. Just after 2 a.m., the officer saw a Dodge Challenger and a Cadillac drag racing in the David Estates neighborhood in the southwest suburb, Miller said. During a search for the vehicles, the officer pulled into a parking lot for an apartment building in the 4000 block of 115th Street in Chicago and found two people inside the Cadillac. The officer and his partner got out of their squad car and told the 25-year-old and his passenger to raise their hands, police said. Instead of following directions, the 25-year-old drove toward the officer, who then opened fire. The Cadillac crashed into vehicles parked in the lot and into a squad car. The 25-year-old was shot twice in the shoulder and was given medical attention by the Alsip officers before paramedics arrived, police said. He was taken to Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn in serious condition. Both officers suffered “minor injuries,” Alsip police said. Miller said the 25-year-old, who has not been charged, was wanted on a warrant out of Indiana on a drug charge and had a “violent history” but did not provide specifics.
Urban, born Jacques Pantaléon in Troyes c. 1200, was elected to the papacy in 1261. He studied canon law at Paris and served as bishop of Verdun and patriarch of Jerusalem. He hoped to keep Sicily from the heirs of Frederick II, whom the council of Lyon excommunicated in 1245, because Urban wanted to restore papal influence in Italy. In 1263, he negotiated with Louis IX of France to put Louis' brother Charles of Anjou on the throne of Sicily. Urban died the following year before the treaty was signed.

AMC Networks Earnings Beat Estimates, CEO Says 'Walking Dead' Franchise "Will Have a Long Life" AMC Networks on Thursday reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings amid higher distribution and advertising revenue as management touted the outlook for hit show The Walking Dead, which is currently in its seventh season and which has been a big topic of debate among Wall Street analysts. AMC Networks shares were up 13.6 percent in early Thursday trading at $65.30 as investors cheered the upside earnings surprise. In the company's earnings report, he had similarly said: "The Walking Dead remains the No. 1 show on television by a wide margin and is a powerful example of programming that we own and distribute that commands a loyal audience, attracts advertising revenue, and has significant ancillary revenues that will benefit our business for years to come. With a rapidly expanding studio business, we now have a growing portfolio of shows that we own that provide this kind of opportunity for our business." Asked about the studio business on the call, Sapan said: "The company is becoming and has become more of a studio,” rather than “only a channel operator.” He said that has allowed its shows to play on its own channels in the U.S. and internationally, then go to Hulu or Netflix in a later window in the U.S. and be sold to other distributors in foreign markets where the company has no channels. AMC Networks so far has not produced shows only for other companies and has no plans to do so, but could consider such a production approach longer-term if the financial returns and strategic benefits make sense, said Sapan. Asked about the company's channel portfolio, Sapan said its quality and pricing counts more than the number of channels at a time when some peers may have to close down weaker channels, according to analysts. "We have been of the mind for some time that quality matters, brands matter, content matters, engagement matters," said Sapan. "And you don’t get a free lunch for showing up with 22 channels." He added that his team felt that "a day of reckoning would come” for some peers. While the company felt SundanceTV and BBC America, in which it bought a stake, are well-defined channels, overall, he said, "we have already skinnied our offering down.” And AMC Networks channels should still get higher carriage fees, he reiterated. “Collectively, they are underpriced," said Sapan. The cable networks company on Thursday posted a profit of $14 million for the latest quarter, or earnings per share of 20 cents, compared with $90 million in the year-ago period, or $1.23. The company in the latest quarter took non-cash impairment charges of $68 million related to AMC Networks International-DMC, its Amsterdam-based media logistics facility. Adjusted for charges, earnings reached $92 million, or $1.30 per share, compared with $102 million, or $1.39 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2015. The decrease in adjusted earnings per share was "primarily related to the increase in adjusted operating income more than offset by an increase in miscellaneous expense." Wall Street analysts had on average expected earnings of $1.27 per share. Estimates had come down a bit after Sapan in December said that advertising was looking softer than anticipated. A 9.2 percent increase in quarterly operating income and 9.2 percent adjusted operating income at the company's U.S. networks, which include AMC, IFC and SundanceTV, reflected higher revenue, offset by an increase in operating expenses. "The increase in operating expenses was primarily attributable to higher programming expenses, partially offset by a decrease in marketing expenses," the company said. "Programming expenses included charges of $5 million in the current-year period related to the write-off of programming assets, as compared to charges of $16 million in the prior year period." The company didn't immediately say which show or shows the write-off was for. U.S. advertising revenue rose 3.1 percent despite lower ratings in the quarter for the first half of season seven of The Walking Dead. U.S. distribution revenue jumped 15.6 percent. "2016 was a successful year for our company both financially and operationally, driven by our disciplined and focused strategy of investing in high-quality content and creating brands that have strong, growing, passionate and engaged audiences," said Sapan. He continued: "We are embracing changing viewing habits by making strategic investments in streaming services that fit well with our programming and the audiences at our network brands. As we look ahead in 2017, we see a number of attractive growth opportunities for our businesses and remain committed to delivering meaningful value to our shareholders. Michael Morris, an analyst with Guggenheim Partners, said in a note previewing the results: "Season 7 of The Walking Dead premiered in late October, and though the show started strong, by the mid-season finale ratings were declining in excess of 20 percent on a year-over-year basis, worse than the 15 percent decline built into our estimates." He lowered his fourth-quarter U.S. networks advertising growth estimate for the fourth quarter to 0.5 percent from 6.0 percent "given The Walking Dead's recent ratings trends." Said Morris: "This is consistent with management commentary provided in December. We expect the show to remain in production — and popular with consumers — for the next several years, and as such we anticipate related ancillary revenue (from digital and international partners) to remain intact." But, he warned, "Investor concern around the company's key Walking Dead franchise continues to weigh on shares. We continue to believe that market value under-appreciates the company’s ability to develop and monetize compelling programming. However, we do not see a clear path to investor realization and thus remain cautious in our target valuation multiple." Sapan on Thursday also touted the ratings performance of the company's networks. And he said that AMC will this year air such returning series as Humans, Better Call Saul and Preacher, plus new shows like The Terror and The Son.
FAISS, including its GPU version (faiss-gpu), primarily works with NumPy arrays. This means that even when using FAISS with GPU support, the input data typically needs to be in the form of a NumPy array. However, this doesn't mean that you can't use PyTorch tensors with FAISS; it just means that you'll need to convert PyTorch tensors to NumPy arrays before using them with FAISS functions.

Not feeling well today, so back in bed at eleven in the morning. Sore throat. Sinus pressure. Yuck. I will say, though, it's nice to be alone up here in my room in the middle of the day with some items I have come to count as dearest companions - my Bible, journal, daily devotion book, thankful journal, and a collection of gel pens. Currently, I am reading Jesus Calling, by Sarah Young. Filled with lovely little reminders of God's presence and His love for me, this daily devotional helps focus my thoughts either to start my day right or rest peacefully during the night. Also by my side today is God's Wisdom for a Mother's Heart, by Bobbie Wolgemuth. This has provided hours and hours of conversation starters for the bi-monthly mentoring group I help lead at my church. Though only 128 pages in length, we have used this book for more than a year. The girls in Moms to Moms meet the first and second Wednesday nights of the month, a sort of round-table, open forum where no topic is off limits, but mostly parenting and reassuring that they're going to make it. We study the Word, pray, laugh, cry, teach each other, and we are all growing. My co-leaders and I agree these young ladies with their children around them are our heroes. Represented are single and married moms, working outside and inside their homes, public/private/homeschooling moms...you name it, we've got it. This is one group we hate to miss. A gift from God. Truly. My thankful journal is simply a little leather-bound book where I record the gifts God has given me. Eucharisto. Thanks. One Thousand Gifts. 10,000 reasons. Why write them down? Because I dare not forget the goodness of God. In the remembering and the acknowledging I am overwhelmed with reassurance that God is my provider, comforter, healer, friend, joy, strength, and so much more. I am much less likely to lose my focus and wander if I am remembering God's deeds and giving thanks. Last, but certainly not least, is my personal journal. It may as well be my heart on paper. This is where it all comes pouring forth to be sorted, processed, saved or discarded. You know, keep the good and throw out the chaff. That's what the journal is for - it is fearsome, yet necessary. Necessary for me anyways. There are a few more books I could talk about. Don't know about you, but I read several at once. These I mentioned were simply the lucky ones to be carried into the sick bed with me today. Do you have reading materials you count as "dearest companions"? What are they and why are they special to you? I also have the Jesus Calling devotional, Karen had mentioned it a long time ago, and I finally got it. I've really enjoyed it, it's definitely helped me focus in on that 'personal' time..

This era of rebellion and freedom lent itself to a more fitted style of clothing. The classic crew neck tee with its slim body has the look of a vintage tee shirt that has been washed and worn hundreds of times. The tee shirts are made of 100% combed cotton, developed exclusively by RE/DONE | Hanes, knitted and sewn entirely in the USA.
As her favourite colour is purple I knew I had to use that colour. A month or so ago I found some purple sugar and white sugar pearls. I wanted to do a kid cake that was elegant given her age. That was as far as I got until the morning of the day everyone was coming. Talk about a decorating block! I just couldn’t think of anything. Fortunately on the walk with the dogs I got an idea. And it had to be done quickly as I had an hour to do this. Yikes! Not only does she like purple, she likes butterflies so I decided to go with that. I whipped up some buttercream icing like I did for these cupcakes. Before I added the purple I scooped some white into a decorating bag. Carefully place the top layer on and brush any loose crumbs off. Ice the whole cake smoothing as best you can. Isn’t this a great purple? Next I used the white frosting to outline the flowers and butterfly. Finally I got the consistency right and it flowed like it should. In the past I was squeezing with all my might. Too much work. I used the white pearls for the centers and the purple sugar for the petals and wings. I really need to problem solve getting the sugar where I want it to go. There was a bit of colouring outside the lines with this bit. To finish it off I added some icing dots on the sides. This entry was posted in Desserts and tagged apples, baking, buttercream icing, chocolate cake. Bookmark the permalink. Wow! that’s one heck of a cake:) It’s beautiful!! I love the butterfly:) She’s going to LOVE IT! Happy Birthday to your daughter…. I can’t wait for those pics…I just love everything about your daughters cake! It came out beautifully!!!!!! Thank you. 🙂 His birthday is in June so I have time to plan! can’t wait! Have a Great weekend:) and as always thanks for sharing…. Thanks, I’ll let her know. Happy Birthday to your daughter. That’s certainly a cake and a half. She must have be thrilled. She liked it. 🙂 They appreciate the effort for stuff like this which is really nice. So fun!! A few years ago, my twin sister put together a cookbook of all the recipes from our childhood years; we celebrated our birthday last week, and I made our whole birthday dinner from that cookbook! It’s amazing how memories if food stay with us– I’m sure your daughter will never forget this cake! What a wonderful idea! Very special. What a sweet cake…love the flowers and butterfly as I’m sure she did as well. Daughters are so~ precious. Happy Birthday to your 12 year old… I love purple too and she will love it! Fae. What a fabulous looking cake! Yes, my favourite colours are deep crimson and purple. Having said that, at your daughters age I had my bedroom painted purple walls and white accents…put me right off purple for a while! Her room at her mother’s house has purple walls so we’ll see how long this lasts. At our house she still has the yellow as the main colour that her dad did years ago. I like the idea of purple with the white accents though. A great contrast. Well happy birthday! Wow! Now that’s purple! I bet she was pleased. Good for her. Happy Birthday to your daughter. A cake to remember always. Love that quote! They grow so fast. Wow Virginia the cake is beautiful! Of course, I like purple, too!
The Western Shoshone call themselves Newe, “The People,” and they refer to their ancestral lands as Newe Sogobia, “The People’s Land.” After living on these lands for thousands of years, the Newe have spent the last 400 defending them from invasion and environmental destruction. Today, the U.S. government occupies much of the Newe Sogobia, using it as a domestic nuclear war zone. The Nevada Test Site was illegally seized from the tribe in the 1940s to use for nuclear weapons testing and as a dump for highly radioactive nuclear waste. Releases of radiation from the detonation of over 1000 nuclear weapons above and below the ground have resulted in cancer clusters and contamination in the communities downwind of the site – and beyond. Newe homelands have been turned into a National Sacrifice Area, or permanently poisoned lands. The latest threat to the Newe is the planned nuclear waste dump at Yucca Mountain located within the Nevada Test Site. The repository will accept over 75,000 tons of fuel rods and other high-level waste across roads and rails from 39 states and place it in a giant hole in the earth found to be seismically unstable and in contact with ground water. Plutonium, the most deadly man-made substance on earth, has a radioactive half-life of 250,000 years, and its nearby storage portends an unparalleled toxic peril for the next 12,000 generations living in the region. Wherever Corbin Harney raises his voice, be it in song, in prayer, or in speech, be it at his homeland, at the UN, or in faraway Kazakhstan, his message is informed with the calm authority imbued him by the earth. In 1994, Corbin Harney founded the Shundahai Network (Shundahai is the Newe word for “peace and harmony with all creation”), a non-profit organization dedicated to breaking the nuclear chain by building alliances with indigenous communities and environmental, peace and human rights movements. They seek to abolish all nuclear weapons and end all nuclear testing, advocate phasing out nuclear energy and ending the transportation and dumping of nuclear waste, and promote the principles of Environmental Justice. Their campaigns and events incorporate the values of community building, education, spiritual ceremonies and nonviolent direct action. I ask for moisture to fall upon us so the grass will start to grow. what we humans tramp down. we tramp it down so it’s flat on the ground. together we have to ask for the rain to come down, so the grass will continue to grow. Corbin Harney’s spiritual strength has become a fountainhead of inspiration for environmental activists around the world. His solution to end the Nuclear Age: we must live in vital, spiritual connection with the earth!
You are buying one beautiful piece of Manzanita driftwood averaging 7 to 10 inches long by 2 " to 3" wide (as seen in the picture) with a full Anubias coffeefolia grown on it. The Anubias Coffeefolia will have 5 or more leaves. Anubias barteri var. coffeefolia is a low cultivar of Anubias barteri. Its characteristic is that the leaves arch considerably between the leaf ribs, and the new leaves are red-brown. The color combination and leaf shape make it an attractive variety in both large and small aquariums. It flowers frequently under water but does not produce seeds. Anubias barteri var. coffeefolia is not eaten by herbivorous fish. I have a few of these available so you are not buying the exact piece shown in the picture but all the pieces will look just as good if not better than the one pictured.
The Cabot is back. A North Shore treasure, the 1920 historic theater was closed and its future unknown until a group of local visionaries found a way to purchase the building and revive performances in 2014. The initiative to save the theater, and initial performances and events, enjoyed widespread and enthusiastic community support. Under the leadership of a new executive director and dedicated Board, much-needed improvements to the physical structure and expanding organizational capacity began. In order to fully realize the potential of this extraordinary moment in time, The Cabot needed new visual and verbal tools that reflected its promise in image and action and could be used to create alignment around a shared vision for the future, address the immediate development need and, critically, create momentum and energy to meet its fundraising goals. Minelli, Inc. worked with key stakeholders and leaders to articulate a strong brand and bring that brand to life, highlighting the Cabot Theater’s timeless beauty and transcendent experiences that evoke the power of memory, creating food for the soul and nourishment for the future.

Sign up to Lineout to stay up to date with all of the latest RUPA news / Thanks for subscribing! With Rugby World Cup (“RWC”) underway the eyes of the world are on our sport. One of the most topical debates across all contact sports is the issue of concussion management. All stakeholders will be looking forward to a RWC in which players, medical personnel and team support staff play their part in managing this important aspect of player welfare. Rugby is making significant progress in the detection and management of concussion and it will be important that other professional rugby competitions move to adopt the standards set for RWC 2015. Rugby should not see the management of concussion as a risk at RWC, but an opportunity to demonstrate how far the game has come in recent times. The International Rugby Players Association (“IRPA”) is constantly thinking about what more can be done to further improve the games ability to manage the issues associated with concussion. Effective from 1st August 2015 after a successful global trial period at elite level, World Rugby has now formally introduced a temporary substitution rule. This applies to any player who is removed from the field of play to undertake a Head Injury Assessment (HIA) when it is unclear if that player has a suspected concussion. Having the ability to remove a player from the action and from the cauldron of a packed stadium, to undertake a thorough clinical assessment and video review of an incident, in a private controlled environment, makes good practical sense. Previously players in this situation would often go untreated, or be checked over briefly on field using questionable methods. World Rugby and other key stakeholders are leading a real culture shift amongst professional players, coaches and medical personnel in relation to peer pressure to play. Recent statistics back this up. Research has underpinned the HIA process throughout. Prior to the temporary substitution trial, 56 per cent of players with a confirmed concussion remained on the field following their injury. Now that figure is less than 12 per cent (British Journal of Sports Medicine, 2014) and the hope is that following continued refinement of the HIA process we will see further improvement in 2015 and beyond. A key point lost on many but one that IRPA believes is fundamental to a conservative management approach is that a player is now removed once the attending medics confirm a diagnosis of suspected concussion. This takes the pressure off trying to make a definitive diagnosis of concussion during a high-pressured game. That does mean players will be removed who have not suffered a concussion, but better the conservative approach. Thankfully the message is getting through and along with World Rugby’s #RecogniseAndRemove campaign, the games stakeholders are realising that it is not just the player’s responsibility but its coaches, referees, and team support staffs obligation to step in if they suspect a concussion has occurred. Whilst IRPA see this as a positive step, it is one that needs to be continually developed and filtered down to the community game where awareness and education on the subject is not yet at the same level. Medical specialist in concussion monitoring individual cases. Additionally, IRPA is very supportive and engaged on the work that is being undertaken on the laws of the game to ensure the risks of on-field instances that result in serious injury, including concussive events, are minimised. There is much conjecture on if rugby, and concussions sustained playing the game, lead to long-term cognitive health issues. From a player’s perspective IRPA does not want that debate to be a distraction from making sure the right thing is done by the players now. IRPA believes that the game should be doing all it can to ensure the welfare and health of the player is an ongoing priority. So what of the future and in particular the debate of using new technologies to take human error out of the equation? One such advancement that may justify further research and refinement is the use of sensors to help aide team doctors with real-time data. It could provide insight into accelerations and forces that they may not have seen first-hand particularly where the player has either not recognised a head knock, chosen not to seek medical assistance or suffered signs and symptoms post game. The sensor does not diagnose a concussion but rather provides accurate previously unavailable live information which combined with testing (HIA) and baseline data can aid in a clinical diagnosis. In the same way team support staff use other data like heart rates and GPS data, the sensor can provide data to assist medical personnel make informed decisions regarding concussion management. From a player welfare perspective, IRPA believes the pressure put on players to return to play to preserve their contracts and the rehabilitative support provided to players recovering from a concussion are areas that should be looked at further. Ensuring a players contractual terms and conditions are supportive during times of serious injury is fundamental. It allows the player the opportunity to fully recover without the added pressure or threat of having his or her salary or match payments stopped, or worse, the contract terminated. In this respect physical injuries are more obvious and certain, concussion in its very nature is obscure and invisible. Currently there are no set guidelines around minimum standards for players’ contractual terms and conditions. IRPA feels that the time is right to address this, not just because of the issues around concussion, but to maintain the integrity and reputation of the game. For those players who endure concussion complications either as part of their return to play process, or following a decision to stop playing, there seems little available to aide recovery beyond rest and time – which for an active professional athlete can be a very uncertain and sometimes depressing experience. IRPA would support more research into identifying rehabilitation techniques and programs to help in the resilience building and recovery process, and to ensure they are readily understood and available throughout the game. World leading player welfare standards are a priority in building the legacy of our sport. It is fundamental to the integrity of the game and to those who participate in it. IRPA is looking forward to continuing to work with World Rugby to bring about the culture change and to enhance the education and regulatory framework that ensures rugby leads the way on concussion management globally. The Rugby Union Players' Association (RUPA) will continue to take a proactive and collaborative approach to concussion prevention and management in Australia sport, as part of its involvement with the Australian Athletes' Alliance (AAA). Every week, RUPA collates five of the best features from the week’s Rugby media and bring them to you in the one convenient location. Charlie Fetoai: Jack of all trades; master of plenty! Former Reds centre Charlie Fetoai was seriously injured in 2009 and told he could never play Rugby again. He spoke to RUPA about what he's been up to since, and the importance of planning for life after Rugby.
Science experiment: Try taking a deep breath through an average soda straw. Not too easy is it? This is basically what your SS has to accomplish with it's stock intake system. Now take a deep breath without that straw in your mouth (for those of you that live in a smog-choked area like Los Angeles or New York City, the State of California wants you to know that this action might be harmful to your health). If you live in a clean area of your state or country, you should feel heartily refreshed afterwards. This is how your SS will feel after you chop the stock intake system and add a new system to help it breath easier. There are many alternatives to get more outside air into your motor, as it is optimal to duct in cooler, more oxygen-rich fresh air, rather than drawing hot oxygen-poor air from the engine compartment with an open-element air cleaner. One in particular that will use a minimum of duct work to direct airflow, is to install a cowl induction or ram-air hood so the engine can draw air directly from the outside of the engine compartment. An added benefit of an induction hood (be it "ram-air" style, cowl induction style, or via a hood scoop) is that as you drive faster, more air is pressurized in the intake tract, thereby "force feeding" your motor an additional charge of air, proportional to the amount of air the engine needs. Plus an induction hood just has that timeless hotrod appeal that oozes with coolness. For this buildup, I chose a cowl induction hood, to give my 454SS a look that dates back to it's muscle car heritage in the SS Camaros, Chevelles, and the like, and to keep it smooth and clean. Some other hotrodders might prefer a later-model Camaro-style ram-air hood. Others might find they need a hood scoop to clear some air cleaner assemblies. It is nothing more than the preference of the buyer. One consideration that is not simply preference is hood material. Realistic, affordable hoods are made out of two materials: steel or fiberglass. Steel hoods are typically more rigid and heavier than glass hoods, and most are a direct bolt-on for the stock hood. Steel hoods also do not require retaining pins on the front of the hood in most instances. There is some variance of quality but most steel hoods are of good to excellent quality, and your body man is probably better suited to work with steel than glass. On the other hand, fiberglass does not rust. Fiberglass does not dent. You can pick up a fiberglass hood (even a superb quality hood). By yourself. A good quality bolt-on glass hood also does not need hood pins to keep it retained. A great quality glass hood costs about the same or less than a steel hood, and due to the lighter weight, costs less to ship. Glass is my choice. Our options- and metal-laden 4800 pound (most of which is in the front) 454SS's need all the weight reduction they can get. Choose your material. Goodmark makes some of the best steel cowl hoods at glass-competitive prices which feature a 2" rise, cowl screen, and boasts an extremely OEM-like fit. They can be reached at 770-339-8557, website www.goodmarkindustries.com. Harwood is THE name in auto fiberglass and Lexan, and they can be reached at 1-800-882-7223, website http://www.martelbros.com/harwood/harwood. Now with your hood selected and delivered, it is time to fit it on your vehicle. Steel hoods, if you bought a good quality one, should fit right onto the stock hinges, and only require adjustment and possibly some shimming to get the hood in the proper location before you prime and paint. Steel will typically come with a protective black paint coat to prevent rust during shipping. Goodmark notes that their protective coat is meant to be sprayed over, like POR-15 rust preventer is. Fiberglass requires more prep work. Unlike steel, fiberglass hoods are not stamped out, and thus, must be trimmed, sanded and otherwise fit to the specific vehicle it is being installed on. First, you must remove the stock hood and hinge springs. If it is a bolt-on hood, operating like the one you are removing from the truck, you will be using all of the hardware from the stock hood on the new hood (a sidenote: unless you are building an all-out race truck, you will probably want the bolt-on hood rather than the lift-off or pin-on style hood that requires removal of the hood every time you want to access the engine bay). Now, lay on the new hood and check for fit. The edges of the hood will need to be trimmed. This may be done with a block sander and coarse sanding paper (80 to 120 grit). Sand off a little, then check again, sand a little more and check, etc. until you have the proper fit and finish. Our trucks have a cowl vent between the hood and windshield. Harwood recommends trimming the back edge of the hood to fit this cowl vent as the stock hood did. Once the hood fits perfect, you are now ready to bolt it on the hinges. Bolt it to the hinges, and the hinges to the truck, and check again for clearance. Included with earlier style Harwood hoods and some other lesser-known brands of hoods is a prop rod. This is intended to hold the hood up, basically taking the place of the hinge springs, as the springs will not be re-used (for steel hoods and for some glass hoods, like the revised Harwood hoods, they are, but most other glass hoods will not withstand this usage). Install the prop rod on the radiator support rail. Harwood said this prop rod is a universal fit, so it is necessary to trim it to fit. Position it in the middle of the hood so as to prevent the hood from twisting while it is on the prop rod. If you position the prop rod to the side, you run the risk of twisting and cracking the hood or paint job. For the later, revised Harwood hoods the company notes that prop rods are not necessary. I spoke with Ray Martel, president of Martel Brothers Performance who owns Harwood, and he said that the bolt-on hoods for many applications have been redesigned and strengthened, allowing one to use the stock hinge springs. If you do not receive a prop rod with your hood, it does not need one, he says. Now you are ready to install the hood latch and spring on the front of the hood. Position the hood and adjust it in using the bump stops and adjustment screws. Check again for fit and operation. After you drive around for a week (or if you are like me, let it sit in the sun for about a week and a half) with an unfinished hood sitting atop your otherwise pristine SS, to allow the gelcoat to stabilize and the fiberglass agents to bond and cure, your truck is now ready to be shipped off to your body shop for finishing, priming, and painting.

The Linux kernel now includes everything that is needed to use 3D acceleration with all GeForce graphics chips. Drivers have also been added for a Wireless Gigabit chip and a PCIe WLAN chip from Realtek. In his email announcing the release of Linux 3.8-rc6, Linus Torvalds emphasised that he wanted the seventh release candidate to be the last one. When he released RC7 on Friday, however, he made no mention of whether there would be an eighth RC before the final version of Linux 3.8. As long as no more major problems arise, though, the Linux kernel 3.8 should still be released this month. This article on driver updates will therefore bring the "Coming in 3.8" Kernel Log mini-series to a close. The first two parts of the series focused on the changes that kernel developers made to filesystems and storage and the platform and infrastructure code for Linux 3.8. In Linux 3.8, the Nouveau kernel driver will include everything that the OpenGL driver â which is part of current versions of Mesa 3D and is also called Nouveau â needs to use the 3D acceleration of all GeForce graphics chips available so far without further configuration. This is the first time that the Nouveau developers, who use reverse engineering to get the information they need to program their drivers, have managed this feat; before this, they were still lacking standard 3D support for some newer Fermi GPUs and the Kepler graphics chips, which have been on the market since March 2012 (1, 2, 3). For many computers, however, NVIDIA's proprietary graphics driver will still be a better choice, since Nouveau can't activate the faster operation modes for many of the newer GeForce chips, resulting in 3D performance that leaves something to be desired. There are also other issues, particularly when it comes to video acceleration and fan management support. Version 3.8 of Linux is the first to include a simple kernel graphics driver for the graphics cores in NVIDIA's TegraÂ 2 and 3 SoCs (system on a chip) (1, 2, 3 and others). The driver is not from NVIDIA; it was developed mostly by a developer from the German company Avionic Design. The company works on embedded solutions in close cooperation with NVIDIA and programmed the driver independently, but with input from NVIDIA. Surprisingly, NVIDIA jumped into the development process, publishing extensions a few weeks ago that let the driver make the graphics cores' acceleration features available, but these improvements did not make it into 3.8. Userland drivers are still needed to use the acceleration functions, and NVIDIA has yet to give any indication that it is interested in releasing those drivers under an open source licence. Nouveau developer Lucas Stach shared background information on the Linux drivers for NVIDIA's Tegra in a presentation at FOSDEM 2013, a recording of which is available on YouTube. The Radeon driver now allows more of the graphics cores' DMA engines, which have previously been largely ignored, to be used from userspace (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The i915 graphics driver now supports by default the graphics cores of the Haswell processors that Intel will introduce under the name Core i4000 in a few months. The developers have also included a workaround for a bug in the Intel 830 and 845 chipsets so the graphics drivers are supposed to be stable on these chipsets. The virtio_net network driver, which uses paravirtualisation and is especially used with KVM and Xen, should provide better performance now that it can use multiple queues for each network device. The same goes for the Tun/Tap driver, which is also used for system virtualisation as well as other purposes like emulating network hardware. The batman-adv (Better Approach To Mobile Ad-Hoc Networking Advanced) mesh implementation developed as part of open-mesh.org to spontaneously create WLAN networks can now build a distributed ARP table, which allows non-mesh clients on a network to receive quick, reliable answers to their ARP queries. The rtl8723ae driver for the Realtek RTL8723AE PCIe WLAN chip is new (1, 2 and others), as is the wil6210 driver for a Wilocity WLAN chip that operates at 60GHz and uses the IEEE 802.11ad standard promoted by the Wireless Gigabit Alliance (WiGig). Another addition to the kernel is the ar5523 driver, which was started over five years ago for the Atheros USB chipset of the same name. Extensions for supporting more chips and WLAN adapters were added to a number of other drivers; the brcmsmac WLAN driver, for example, now supports the BCM43224 Broadcom chip, while the rt2800usb RaLink driver supports the Sweex LW323 USB WLAN adapter. The cdc-mbim driver, which supports broadband modems that implement Mobile Broadband Interface Model (MBIM ) 1.0, specified by the USB Implementers Forum, is also new (1, 2). MBIM is a USB protocol for connecting modems for laptops, tablets and desktop computers that provide an internet connection using GSM and CDMA-based 3G and 4G (including LTE). Aleksander Morgado provides more details on the protocol and its advantages compared to other technologies in a blog post. The kernel's audio drivers now support the Philips PSC724 Ultimate Edge sound card. The kernel can also handle VIA's VT1705CF HD audio codec now. The merge listing the most important changes to Linux 3.8's sound subsystem includes some other changes to audio drivers. The kernel now includes a driver for human interface devices (HIDs) that use I2C (1, 2 and others), using the "HID over I2C" protocol designed by Microsoft and implemented in WindowsÂ 8. Extensions were added to the HID multitouch driver to support some of the features for better finger and movement recognition found in WindowsÂ 8. The drivers for Video4LinuxÂ 2 (V4L2) located in the media subsystem can now use the "DMA Buffer Sharing Mechanism" (dma_buf) integrated in Linux 3.3 to share buffer space with graphics cards, which makes it possible that data from video hardware will no longer need to be duplicated in the buffer in order for a graphics chip to display it. The kernel developers have marked the uas driver, which handles the USB Attached SCSI protocol, as broken because it causes problems and is not yet ready for the major distributions. Alan Cox has given up kernel development for family reasons, leaving his position as maintainer of the serial driver subsystem. Cox is a Linux veteran who maintained the Linux kernel 2.2, during which time he was considered the second most important kernel developer after Linus Torvalds. Although he hasn't been that far up in the ranks these last few months, Cox has still contributed quite a lot to the development of Linux.

Did you know that reviews are very beneficial? A review is assessment of something in order to institute change if necessary. Reviews are quite a crucial deal in our daily business activities. This article tries to point out the most important aspects of having reviews. Enlisted below are some of the benefits of reviews. First and foremost is that reviews form ac channel of free advertisement. A review posted by a customer is always an advantage to you because this is a form of advertisement to an individual's business. With these posts your products are placed on the market and your name is put to light with quality products. For more info on Reviews, click here to learn more. More so, with online review you can provide a vast exposure to masses of people that the local channels of marketing could not have accomplished. Secondly, reviews have a greater influence on peer recommendation. Research has shown that most people would actually prefer peer recommendations. Most people would actually prefer reference and recommendations on several market products from people they have knowledge of. Recommendations will put your products to the market and thus enable growth of your enterprise therefore, making reviews very important. On to the third benefit is that reviews always attract constructive criticism and reasonable suggestions. Some of the online reviews might raise questions relating to one's enterprise and suggest some possible solutions that may be aimed at improving such doubts. This can be a good practice that is aimed at improving customer needs and preferences. Satisfied customers will actually enhance the growth of your business and thus encourage peer recommendations and references leading to a more established business. On to the fourth benefit is that reviews bring you closer to your customers. Like other channels example social media reviews will bring you ultimately closer to your customer. To read more about Reviews, visit www.crunchreviews.com/baby-tech/best-video-baby-monitor. As a business owner you are at a position to read and evaluate a range of customer's opinion. With this you can reply to customers with either positive or negative reviews showing that you are much interested with what customers actually suggest. Showing customers that you value their suggestions will bring you closer to them and thus allow you to gain respect among them. Lastly, reviews will actually improve your search engine results. Search engine results take into account the number of times your business is mentioned in reviews. Therefore, with more mentions you are likely to appear in a higher rank.

Are you thinking about using online assignment help platforms? If you answered yes, then you are definitely not alone. This service is increasing in popularity across the globe. It makes it easier for students to handle their school requirements. But the nature of the service remains shrouded in controversy. After all, teachers and professors give out assignments for a reason. They are meant to boost the skills of students both inside and outside the classroom. This begs the question: Do assignment help services benefit or hurt students? It’s easy to see the benefits of hiring assignments experts to aid in your academic pursuits. They solve the problem of insufficient time to do homework’s, especially if you take on multiple part-time jobs after school hours. As you know, writing essays or completing complicated assignments can take up a boatload of time. Between gathering information and adding the final touches, your assignment can take several hours to finish. The speed with which you can finish your assignments with the help of service providers like the guys at Do My Assignments is another huge benefit. Most companies accept expedited requests for an extra fee. It’s possible to get your paper or assignment in as little as 24 hours. While these aforementioned benefits are surely hard to resist, it’s worth noting that using assignment writing services offers more than meets the eye. At first, it might not appear to make sense that hiring assignment help providers can improve your research skills. You don’t even need to research about anything. They will do everything for you, and this is where you can get tips from the experts. By looking at the final output of the assignment expert, you could see how much it differs from the homework’s you have done yourself. It shouldn’t come as a surprise if these differences are very noticeable. You could tell that time and effort has been dedicated to producing such a well-researched assignment. Even the references and links can help you with your future requirements, as you would see how much more credible your work will look like if the links aren’t limited to Wikipedia. The same applies to your presentation skills. The way the essay, research paper, or assignment is formatted can give you ideas on how to better structure your content. Notice how the ideas flow smoothly throughout, allowing you to get the point across even without the use of fancy words. You probably have a “go-to” format for your essays, but you’ll realize that it doesn’t always work. It’s easy to dismiss assignment writing services as only for lazy students who do not care at all about learning. But it’s important to understand that the students can enjoy much more than its time-saving benefits. With the help of experts, you can pick up some tips on how to research about a topic, what credible sources to use, and how to present your ideas in a way that engages readers. All of these can prove beneficial for any student, even the ones who do remarkably well in class.
Becoming a professional coach is one of the most rewarding jobs I’ve ever had. It’s such an honor to be able to help people grow in their personal leadership skills and pursue their true purpose and passions to make a huge impact in the world. I love facilitating “a-ha moments” for people and guiding them towards success. I never thought I would become a coach because I didn’t even know that the coaching industry existed until about 3 years ago. Since then, I learned more about it, volunteered and practiced it as much as I could, and took steps to call this my career. Today, I wanted to answer some FAQs for people who are interested in becoming a coach or adding coaching skills to their repertoire. As you read this, imagine us chatting together at a coffee shop with the freedom for you to pick my brain. My hope is that this gives you more insight to the industry and provides a little bit of direction of your next steps. Q: I love helping people. I’ve always enjoyed mentoring and guiding younger people. Is coaching right for me? A: Yes! The heart of coaching is helping people to figure out what they want, why they want it, and provide the support and accountability for them to be successful. When you get down to it, a coach sees someone for their potential and equips them with the skills and resources for them to be the best version of themselves. A coach is someone who wants to facilitate change, growth, and get people from where they are now to where they want to be. It’s definitely considered to be a “helping profession.” It doesn’t necessarily have to be with someone younger than you, but people tend to work with coaches that they can relate to. The question to ask yourself is, “WHY do you want to become a coach?” Get clear on your definition of success. If it’s genuinely to help people get better in a motivating way, then coaching may be a good fit for you. Q: What are my options as a coach? // What can I do as a coach? A: There are many paths you can take, or make yourself! Typically you could: be to go-to coach for your current company, be a coach that consults for other companies, or start your own private coaching business/practice. There are many different niches as well: including health/wellness, business, life, executive, leadership and success, and career. Or, you could get coach training for basic coach skills (communication, listening, asking questions, goal-setting/accountability) that could equip you to be a better leader in your current job. Q: How can I get started with coaching? A: Start Where You Are! First, if you’ve never experienced working with a coach yourself, I highly encouraged you to do it. That way, you know first-hand what it’s all about. You can go to local workshops and seminars hosted by a coach, or invest in working with one yourself. Then, the best way to see if coaching is right for you as a career is to engage in opportunities to learn and practice coaching. Find people and opportunities where you can offer your listening ear and expertise. If you're working 9-5, what are some ways you can add value to your company by helping others grow? For example, it could be a book club, speaking in a professional development series, or creating an accountability group. The key is to find practical ways to practice (even if it’s on your friends!) Think of it as an experiment: Who do I love to help? What kind of problems are they dealing with? What value am I providing them? Do I even like this? Something you can try to practice with people one-on-one: create a survey asking questions about people’s needs and desires, send it out to friends and people in your network, and offer a mini-coaching session to those who have filled it out. This gives you a better idea of what people need and are looking for, and also real-world experience in coaching people. Q: Do I need training or certification? A: Getting training is like the difference between between street smart and and school smart. You may naturally have great coaching skills, but training hones them to take to the next level. I like to think of it like the difference between a street basketball player and a professional one. A street basketball player is naturally skilled and may have fun playing the game, but when you’re ready to go pro, training helps provide structure and expertise, and confidence in helping you know what you’re doing. Coach training is an investment and can range from $500-$2000 per module (and even up to $10,000 for the whole shebang), so carefully consider it before going all in. I went to Erickson International, and have heard good things about Co-Active Coach Training, and Lifeforming. Certification is getting officially registered by the International Coach Federation. You need to have at coach training and at least 100 hours in order to apply. It’s a great route to consider if you value professional development, and a must-have if you want to work for corporate companies for executive/leadership coaching. A lot of corporate companies will only hire coaches with those credentials. But if you worked with clients one-on-one in your own private practice, it’s not necessary. Keep in mind that clients buy for results. As long as you provide value and results, clients will be happy to work with you. Building a business takes a lot of time and persistence. It’s one thing to be a great coach but it’s another thing to be a great business owner. It takes a lot of focused intention and attention, and it doesn’t happen overnight. I always say that building a business is the BEST personal development because you’re always learning new things (that constantly keep changing) and pushing yourself to grow. People don’t buy coaching, they buy results. This is a marketing thing. To more clear you are about who you help and how you help them, they better chance you’ll find the people you’re meant to serve and get paying clients. I naively thought that saying “I can coach!” would attract people to me. Instead, I had to learn some savvy marketing skills and get clear on my audience, message, and services. Things are constantly changing. Things within the industry are constantly changing. The coach I was one year ago is way different than the coach I am today (for the better!) Business is the same way. Things that worked before may not worked now. So I’m constantly experimenting with new marketing channels and offerings. I like the challenge of trying new things, but I’m also balancing it with trying to remain consistent in things like my voice and helpful habits. Invest in things that matter. Some people may think the only expenses needed for an online coaching business is a laptop, internet, and a phone (which you already have). But realistically, start-up costs could be education, training, web site/marketing materials/branding, office supplies, legal fees, etc. Those things add up. It’s good to have a budget to set aside money to invest in things to matter to you. For me, that was education, branding, and working with a coach. Q: What are your favorite books/resources? A: I love reading! Here’s a list of my recommended books for leadership, business, and creativity. I continue to add to the list, so let me know what your recommendations are! I hope this Q+A session helped you get a better peek into our world and give you clarity for the direction of your coach journey. My vision is that someday coaching will become more mainstreamed and that everyone would be equipped with basic coaching skills. Wouldn’t that be AWESOME?!

Many materials are available in both English and Spanish. FSNE’s multilevel interventions positively influence individual health behaviors, while also targeting the policies, systems, and physical environments (PSEs) of collaborating sites in an effort to improve access to healthy choices among Maryland residents.In FY16, trained trainers/collaborating partners alone provided education to almost 1/4 (5,861 individuals) of the total participants reached by FSNE.Although most of FSNE’s nutrition education occurs during in-person sessions, FSNE also employs a number of unique indirect methods for accessing a hard-to-reach adult audience.The historic Cole Field House basketball arena in College Park, Maryland, was redeveloped by architecture firm Cannon Design, and in response, Maryland Athletic Director Kevin Anderson said, “This is a game-changer for our university.” According to the , the University of Maryland became the last football program in the Big Ten to have an indoor practice field. Even with this, there is still so much more to expect. This project, costing approximately $45 million, is only the first phase of what is expected to be the largest fundraising project in the history of this university.

during our conversation it became apparent Jerome has developed a great approach to the sport, being backed by a good team, coupled with a dynamic fighting style, he is definitely one to watch. “I started boxing when I was 21, so I started late, I just went to the gym with a friend, I had always watched boxing but never took that much of an interest in it. After I went to the gym once I got a feel for it, everything about it, the environment, the smell of the gym and from there it has catapulted, it became an obsession, it went from a hobby to a lifestyle. “I had 35 fights, I won the Haringey box cup, I reached the national finals in 2016, I won London titles twice, so yeah, in the last two years I’ve seen my amateur career take off. “You know what it is, I am a strong believer in timing, and at the age of 26 I wasn’t going to gain much more from the amateurs, as in it might take me away from what I want to do as a pro. “So, I’ve got guys at the IQ Boxing Gym in Neasden, North West London, my main coach is Xavier Miller, and my promoter is Steve Goodwin. Me and Xavier get along like a house on fire, as much as I like him as a coach, I also do as a person. We have a good understanding and it’s a great relationship. “So, like I said, as an amateur I was relying a lot on reflex, movement, counter punching, but not as a pro, I’m going to focus on sitting my weight down, catching shots, returning shots and working the body. I would love to say I can adapt to any shape or style but I have to be realistic, I would say that I’m a thinking fighter, I can work out people’s fight quite quickly so I can entertain different styles. “Without trying to sound arrogant or cocky I feel like I’ve got the makings to go all the way, I feel like I’m destined for great things and it’s a matter of time until everyone else starts to believe it. In 2018 I’m just looking to get the whole experience, and I think if I could get 4 fights this year I would be happy with that, I’m looking to soak up the experience and fight in front of a big hyped up crowd. I’m also sparring 6-8 rounds at the moment so 4 rounds shouldn’t be too bad. Jerome Campbell makes his debut tonight on Goodwin Boxing’s ‘Venom’ show at the infamous York Hall. Featuring on a strong card, Jerome is bout #6 of the evening. 4 x 3 minute rounds in the lightweight division, sharing the ring with Luke Fash.
My practice is built on my respect for human resiliency: a belief in our ability to move forward from great difficulty and deep hurts as well as break patterns that are no longer serving us. I approach my clients with warmth and curiosity and seek to nurture a holding space that feels safe to address whatever unique concerns they bring. In sessions, I am engaged and accessible. I start with clients’ present concerns and also facilitate interest in their deeper selves. Having been personally inspired by the positive impact of psychotherapy, I am passionate about walking alongside others navigating this courageous process. I enjoy working with adults dealing with life transitions, grief and loss, family of origin concerns, relationship issues, trauma, sexuality concerns, and anxiety. I also have a special interest in fertility-related struggles, pregnancy and postpartum concerns, difficult or traumatic birth experiences, miscarriage, stillbirth, and infant loss. I practice from a psychodynamic perspective, an approach that is curious about how our past is impacting our present, while also using interventions rooted in cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness. I also offer Somatic- and Attachment-Focused EMDR which is an integrative, physiological psychotherapy approach.

There are few moments in life this fast paced, that take you this much by surprise. Where after the adrenaline high, you can’t believe it just happened to you. This is their story. Be sure to watch the video as well as browse through the photos as mom tells what happened from her perspective. Ben’s parents were already at the hospital for an induction. Last checked, she was 2 cm dilated and not in active labour at all. The induction medication hadn’t even begun. I normally come when a client is in active labour as this early period could be slowed down by my presence. I texted with dad who told me we would touch base in an hour. I texted to see how things were going. Heard nothing for about 10 minutes and just had this gut feeling. I threw on my scrubs. My gear was already at the house and my childcare had been called in. I knew it would be today just not sure when. Utter disbelief. What was he talking about? She wasn’t even in labour. This was a first baby. Complete as in completely dilated and at a 10? Maybe dad wasn’t familiar with the terms. I put my keys in my pocket. I screamed at my childcare “I gotta go, bye, I’m walking out, you are on duty, bye” and walked right to the car. I was driving away a minute later. The drive had my heart pumping like never before. I knew this could go either way, some first time moms push for one to two hours so I might have time. Some deliver with in a couple pushes. I parked in exactly 20 minutes from when I walked out my door (went back and checked all my text time stamps). I ran up to maternity and heard a baby crying from a delivery room. My heart sank. I knew. He was laying on her chest and it was the first natural birth that ever beat me to it! This was a precipitous labor, which is defined as a labor that lasts no more than three hours from onset of regular contractions to delivery. Maybe you could call hers ultra-precipitous? The room no less, was full of peace, and with in the first minute of being there I began shooting. The looks of disbelief and utter joy were plastered all over their faces. Ben’s parents have graciously allowed me to share their birth in part to glorify God publicly for his miraculous life. The images chosen, many that are not in the video, I selected almost all black and white because in this case, its just so visually stunning when laid together. In case you are wondering, my clients receive all of their images in colour and black & white for every session. To Ben’s parents, the joy and graciousness you carry exudes from a deep place of knowing truth. What a gift your son has in having you both to raise him. Thank you for hiring me. I’m slightly terrified if you hire me again that I might just camp outside your house for a week. To the hospital staff and Dr. Brandt at Netcare Blaauwberg Hospital, my sincerest thank you’s for letting me run in all out of breath and document their day.

Summer School for Mom Series Lifestyle Search RSS Menu Menu Back to Top How-To 10 Ways to Become a Better Editor By DIYHsr 20 Jan 2016 17 Jul 2018 So you have your children writing every day. Great! Now, of course, you need to become their editor. Here is where some find a challenge in the natural approach to language arts. What if I don’t feel competent to edit my child’s writing? We’ll address the underlying problem with that argument further down, but for now — here are 10 ways to become a better editor of your child’s writing. 1. Read A Strong Start in Language. This Ruth Beechick title for beginning grades is recommended widely — from The Well-Trained Mind to Sonlight. Typically packaged as part of The Three Rs, A Strong Start in Language helps you become the editor from the beginning — from the time your child traces his first letters, to copywork, and through dictation. Read our full review (scroll down). 2. Read You Can Teach Your Child Successfully. Over 100 pages are devoted to writing in this followup to the Three Rs by Ruth Beechick mentioned above. The book speaks to you as your child’s tutor and therefore includes writing activities, writing lessons to get you started and that you can pattern your own lessons after, and suggestions for usage, grammar, mechanics, and spelling. Best of all it tells you what you can expect from your child at various levels on the writing scale. Very valuable reference to finding your way as you teach writing naturally to your children and we cannot recommend it highly enough. You can read our full review (scroll down). 3. Use Learning Grammar Through Writing. This handy reference published by Educators Publishing Service is now out of print. But it is worth finding. When you find a mistake in your child’s writing, you can find the coordinating pithy rule with an example to have your child copy into a grammar notebook. A checklist at the back helps you keep track of the skills you have covered. 4. Read good books. The best way to improve your editing is to read good writing. While you work through the suggestions above, you can be building your foundation in good writing at the same time. 5. Make use of a dictionary. Before the days of Kindle we had electronic dictionaries handy that included a grammar reference. Although somewhat pricey, the better models not only include the definitions, but also the etymology of the word. Most also come with a built-in thesaurus and other tools. If nothing else, a good dictionary can shed some light on how words are properly used in sentences. 6. Learn to diagram. Not popular with some, but a valuable skill for understanding how words work in sentences. There are easy online courses that can help you quickly learn the basics. For simple and easy practice we like The Complete Book of Diagrams by Mary Daily published by The Riggs Institute Press, which also is a great help for Mom. 7. Use Learn to Write the Novel Way. While your child writes his novel as he works through this book, you have a guide that helps you edit your child’s writing. Learn by doing. Read our full review. 8. Read The Elements of Style. This widely recommended classic by Strunk and White holds the title for the most concise and simple usage, composition, and spelling reference. There is even an early version in the public domain. 9. Read How to Write Clearly by Ruth Beechick. Subtitled, The Meaning Approach, this is another handy writing reference that covers finding a topic, getting organized, outlining, using abstract and concrete terms, sentences, comma usage, active and passive voice, choosing words, usage, and more! Read our full review. 10. Learn Latin. It’s never too late. Having a working knowledge of how Latin works is probably one of the best ways to understand how the English language works. You will also want a grammar reference. Our favorite grammar reference is the Handbook of Grammar and Composition published by A Beka. We purchased it on a recommendation in The Well-Trained Mind and haven’t looked back. Now, back to the initial question: what if you don’t feel competent to edit your child’s writing? You do know how to write, yes? In this day of streaming output you may even write for a blog or other publication. Using the ideas above, you should be able to stay ahead of your child’s work. Of course, at some point, if you feel you are losing ground there are many qualified and reputable online writing tutors available. Additional Resources Handbook of Grammar & Composition from A Beka This is our favorite reference for the older student who is writing well. Will carry a student through the upper grades and beyond. 16 Tips: Building a Better Writer What to have your child do. “Natural” Language Arts Scope and Sequence {Free} More structure for those who need it. 10 Ways to Use Notebooking: #4 Writing Where to put the writing. 10 Ways to Use Notebooking: #5 Grammar & Spelling You’ll also want to have your child keep one of these.

Taste of Macau: The ultimate guide of becoming a (chubby) Pig in Macau – its Pinkwanderlust Skip to content its Pinkwanderlust Count the memories. Menu About me Graphic Design portfolio Unlucky Luck travel book (prototype) Categories Austria California England France Germany Los Angeles Macau New York City Peru Thailand USA West Coast Instagram Notre Dame Cathedral is one of the first cathedral i've been to in my life. I remember i was so amazed by the grandeur of its architecture. The second i walked in, it felt peaceful and calming. It was just a magical experience that i'll always remember. I believe its beauty and charm will remain forever. ❤️ Merry Christmas! ❄️🎄🎅🏽 Always by your side 💞 Winter wonderland ❄️ The holiday seasons are upon us 🎅🏽🎉🎄 There's something peaceful about looking at a city from above. Watching lives go by is truly inspiring. I see you Chrsyler Fitting in is boring, be fiercely you. Lil flowery escape to the rose garden 🌹 FB Fanpage FB Fanpage Follow its Pinkwanderlust on WordPress.com Taste of Macau: The ultimate guide of becoming a (chubby) Pig in Macau Posted on April 20, 2015 October 1, 2015 by itspinkwanderlust Did you know? Macau cuisine is the original fusion food. Macanese food is mixture between Chinese and Portuguese! (This happened through the times when Macau was administered by Portugal from mid 16th century to almost the 21st century, 1999 to be exact!) With its rich historical culture, it is no wonder why their food has such a vibrant variety, from Chinese, Cantonese, Portuguese to Macanese. Today I’m gonna take you for a ride of the marvelous food I’ve tried in Macau, from street food to Michelin star restaurants. ✯✯✯✯✯ ☞ Antonio’s (Michelin recommended, Louis Vuitton city guide, Tatler best restaurants and so much more) Location: Taipa Village Website: http://antoniomacau.com/ Definitely my favorite restaurant in Macau. If you want to experience the authentic Portuguese Macanese dishes, with live one man band (sings with guitar) and cozy ambience. This is it. For extra boost to add on to your one-in-a-lifetime experience, try order Crepe suzette! 3-michelin-stars Chef Antonio himself will invite you to join him cooking at your table and be prepared for a fiery ride! One of many Signature dish – Seafood rice! African chicken – the sauce tastes similar to curry It’s getting hot in here -Flaming Chouriço! Cooking crepe suzette! Be careful with the alcohols! Tadaaa! Proudly present Crepe suzette by Chef Antonio and Me! ☞ Restaurante Litoral Location: Macau Peninsula Website: http://www.restaurantelitoral.com/ Another popular local traditional Portuguese Macanese restaurant with more mature settings and environment. The famous african chicken – this one’s a lil spicy! But superb! Hi Crabby!!!! Portuguese Vegetable soup – soft taste of potato 🙂 Steamed clams! Make sure you dip the bread in the sauce! Yum! Bolinhos de bacalhau – salt cod fishcakes, like fish in mash potato and fried Sauteed shrimp with garlic butter Not a complete Portuguese meal without the Chouriço Pick 1…hmm… Ended with my favorite traditional dessert in Macau! Serradura! ☞ Restaurante Espaco Lisboa Location: Coloane A cute romantic Portuguese-Macanese restaurant nearby the famous original Lord Stow’s egg tart bakery! Portugal is also famous for their glazed tiles. So lovely! Salad for starter! Sauteed shrimp with garlic butter! African Chicken!!! Love!! Soaky wet Portuguese seafood rice! A must! Fried fishiess Pork ribs!! Love the salty taste! The french fries sure stole the spotlight from the pork steak! This cherry whisky is STRONG!! be careful! Pineapple, Mango, Peach juices! Loving these rejuvenating refreshments! Just can’t get enough! Lovely meal indeed! Bon appétit! ☞ Lord Stow’s Bakery (original branch) Location: Coloane Website: http://www.lordstow.com/ One of the things that pops up in people’s mind when speaking of Macau, is the Egg tart! And when speaking of egg tart in Macau, everyone will tell you to go to Lord Stow’s bakery! A lil fun fact: there’s another similar bakery near Senado Square called Margaret’s e nata café, the owner? Lord Stow’s ex-wife! No wonder why it tastes so familiar huh ;p The famous Egg tart!! It’s shooo gooood u guyz!! ☞ Dynasty 8 Location: Conrad Macau, Cotai Central Website: http://www.sandscotaicentral.com/macau-restaurants/chinese-food/dynasty-8.html A regular Chinese restaurant, but what impressed me the most is the fact that they have a short tiny table where ladies can put their bag on while eating! Talk about hospitality! A major problem for all ladies who carry handbags, basically everyone! We always need to get extra chair, or hang it on the chair, or let the bag share half of our chair! So Bravo! And obviously the food is Goo-Oood tooo! HEre i picked out my favorite dishes! Crispy pork! Not oily at all! Crispy Spring rolls stick filled with shrimp and mangos! Chicken and mushroom filled puff Steamed crystal dumplings with assorted mushrooms Creepily took photo of the tiny chair for ladies’ bag from the next table ;p ☞ Jade Dragon Restaurant (Michelin starred restaurant) Location: City of Dream, Cotai strip Website: http://www.cityofdreamsmacau.com/dining/chinese/jade-dragon Probably the most exclusive and expensive restaurant with millions of dollars on investment, from the interior designs, décor, utensils and obviously the exquisite ingredients for the dishes that are created by Chef Tam Kwok Fung. Be prepared for a fabulous Chinese fine dining. Prepared for a memorable meal! Tiny portion, long name, here we go! Crispy yam and vegetable roll serve with sweet and sour sauce, marinated black fungus with garlic and cucumber in aged italian balsamic vinegar, deep fried bean curd with spicy salt, jade dragon dumpling! As hot as its name – Hot and Sour soup with shredded pleurotus mushroom Don’t let the simplicty appearance fool you. It’s Lychee wood roasted crispy chicken with black truffle! Umm yummz! Best BBQ pork i’ve ever had! So soft with nice honey scent – Jade dragon Prime cut Barbecue Iberico Pork Pluma ♡ Ain’t a normal fried rice – Jade dragon Signature fried rice wit prawn, sakura shrimp, conpoy and roasted goose Tossed noodles with Prime Cut iberico Barbeque Pork, shrimp roe and spring onion ♡♡♡BEST CREME BRULEE in the WORLD!!! – Chinese Almond Crème brûlée with Bird’s nest and Honey! The taste, the smell, the touch, the looks! ♡♡♡ Mini ice cream – petit fours, but what should be discussed hear is the pot that it came in! The dry ice keeps it cool with white smoke coming out. Truly a piece of culinary art ♡ Here you can see even clearer the smoke coming out of the dragon’s mouth! ROAR! ♨ ☆ Most Magical Memorable Meal ☆ With the Chef Tam Kwok Fung in his Kitchen! Thank you so much for such a great dining experience! ☺ ☞ Lua Azul Location: Macau Tower Website: https://www.macautower.com.mo/dining/lua-azul Looking for Dimsum? Looking for fine dining setting? Looking for traditional Guangdong culinary? Look no further! Look for Lua Azul! Enjoy the numerous dimsum menu they offered, but better yet, the taste will make you smile like a crazy person! Or is that just me? Welcome! Shredded jellyfish and chicken salad Not a complete dimsum meal without Ha-Gao! Highly recommended – Spring rolls with smoked salmon and shrimp in mustard sauce. YUMSSSSS ! Somewhat like vegetarian shumai Can’t get enough of these Mango Pomelo Sago ♡ TADAAA!!! Dimsum heaven! ☞ Leitaria I Son Location: Near Senado square Need something cool? Or something hot? Not too much, not too little. Just to warm up or cool down. Here I highly recommend you steamed milk pudding with red beans! (Well im a big red beans lover) Everytime I go, the café is always packed! And I know exactly why! Go try yourself! When you see this sign, you know you’re there! The famous steamed milk pudding! Comes in both hot and cold! Your call! Also egg Pudding! ☞ Patisserie at MGM (aka Pastry bar) Location: MGM hotel , Macau peninsula Website: http://www.mgmmacau.com/pastry-bar “The only things more colorful than the décor are the fragrant whiffs of savory goodies.” Their quote didn’t do them justice. Not just the smell, but the taste! The looks! It’s a brillian work of art. You’ll feel very girly at this Pastry Bar being undecisive of which one to eat. A Truly Desserts heaven! Can you feel dat? Dat magic power luring you in! oopsy daisy! Raspberry lover! Oh caramel christmas treeee ~ Hot cocoa unlike any other place!!! Look at it! Pulled pork sandwich worth the try! ☞ Prive French restaurant Location: Sofitel Macau Ponte 16 Website: http://www.sofitelmacau.com/en/prive.html An Exceptional French fine dining experience, this small upscale boutique French restaurant has only 24 seats available with a gorgeous view of Macau. Each dish is well paired up with French wine. And don’t underestimate the small portion, I almost didn’t have enough belly space for desserts.! (Untrue, all girls always have extra space for desserts) Don’t be fooled by the looks! Yummiest soup ever! Caesar salad with William Fevre petit chablis – Burgundy, France Smoked seabass with Chartron la fleur blanc Bordeaux, France Pan fried french scallop with Domaine Paul Jaboulet Aine Parallel 45 – Cotes du rhon France Strawberries a la prive with Charles de fere Blanc de Blanc – Burgundy France French wine family photo Mini desserts :))) Cooking demonstration for each dish ☞ Robuchon Au Dome (3 michelin stars) Location: Grand Lisboa hotel, Macau peninsula Website: http://www.grandlisboahotel.com/dining-Robuchon_au_Dome-en Exquisite experience! Feeling pampered at this gorgeous 3 michelin stars restaurant, situated at the dome of Grand Lisboa hotel that overlooks the Macau peninsula. Too bad the day I went was a little foggy though L When you enter this restaurant, you will feel like a royalty, from the excellent service, marvelous food; a truly mixture of art and culinary, spectacular interior design; the chandelier, the plates, the décor, the grand piano… urgh everything is a dream! Crab meat served with white asparagus, panna cotta refreshed with tomatoes symphonies Méli-mélo of smoked foei gras shavings and marinated potato with virgin olive oil Shellfish bisque spiced with piment d’Espelette and shredded cod fish Stewed maine lobster claw with sorrel and spring vegetable pearls on spelt risotto 🙂 Grilled sea bass fillet escorted with green peas puree and saffron juice with ginger fragrance Yes!

Below are some photos from cafes/restaurants worth mentioning!

Cyrsti's Condo: The Right or Wrong Person for the Job? Cyrsti's Condo Your Transgender Girl in the Neighborhood-JJ'S HOUSE! Tuesday, August 25, 2015 The Right or Wrong Person for the Job? I really don't know how many times I have sworn myself off the "allure" or lack of it from Caitlin Jenner. Kristin Beck Of course I know the non negotiables. Without a doubt she is the biggest public relation's splash ever in the transgender community. Now we have a former Olympic hero along with Navy Seal Kristin Beck as recent "coming out" stories. In fact, Kristin is running for US Congress. I am sure Jenner's life will ever allow her to ever experience the everyday lives we live as transgender women. Can you imagine the paparazzi crowding into a women's restroom with her? After watching her last show rater intently (and knowing it's a glossy over produced Kartrashian show) I couldn't see the emotion in Jenner. Again, I don't know all the facts about her, except she went out and bought the best plastic surgery money could buy. Again, maybe that's why I can't see any emotion in her face-she can't move it!!!! Plus, I have no idea how long she has been back on HRT. It took me three years on hormones to begin to see the world in a different way. When I watch Jenner, I wonder if she has passed over (no pun intended) to the feminine side much at all. She tries to overtalk most people and doesn't want to listen for the real problems-typical male. Then again, maybe I am just watching the true quandary of a Mtf gender transition play out with Jenner. I don't question the pure persistence and strength it takes to jump the gender fence. It will be interesting to see in the years to come what happens with Jenner. Will a "softer-gentler" Caitlin truly begin to enjoy a life in the girls sandbox? Or, will the ego trip of doing it still be more important? at August 25, 2015 Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Labels: Caitlin Jenner, HRT, Kristin Beck, MtF gender transition, transgender, transgender women No comments: Post a Comment Newer Post Older Post Home Subscribe to: Post Comments (Atom) Featured Post Bucket List Friday Well, it's the most anticipated shopping day of the year...Black Friday.

Includes pharmaceutical grade EPA and DHA for maximum purity and quality. In stock Quantity Add to cart FREE Shipping! Bulk Savings Quantity Price 2 $17.05 3 $16.16 Description Highlights Ingredients FAQ Videos Reviews (4) EPA and DHA, Fats from Fish Oil, are Essential for Optimal Male and Female Fertility Do you have a fear of dietary fat? If your answer is yes, it wouldn’t be surprising, given that for several decades now we have been told that eating foods that contain fat is bad for our waistlines and our hearts. This fear of dietary fat has given rise to a huge demand for low fat foods, and the aisles of the grocery store are now stocked with reduced-fat and fat-free options of just about every food imaginable. But, unfortunately, our obsession with avoiding all types of dietary fat comes at a cost for fertility. While it is certainly true that too much of the wrong types of fat, namely saturated fats and trans fats, are not good for our overall health, there are certain types of fat that are, in fact, essential to good health and optimal fertility. FH Pro Omega 3 contains the fats you need to support optimal reproductive health and fertility. Why are Omega-3 Fats Beneficial for Fertility Omega 3 fats are necessary for optimal reproductive health and fertility, and it is likely that you are not getting enough. Omega-3 fats are considered to be “essential” to the human diet because the body depends on these fats for a variety of functions, but cannot synthesize them – hence the need to consume foods and supplements containing Omega-3 fats. The best food sources of Omega-3 fats are flaxseed oil and fish oil, but, again, if you are like most Americans, a 2014 study indicates that you are not meeting recommended levels for Omega-3 fat intake. (Papanikolaou Y, et al. U.S. adults are not meeting recommended levels for fish and omega-3 fatty acid intake: results of an analysis using observational data from NHANES 2003-2008. Nutritional Journal 2014:13:31.) Fish oil deserves special attention here because certain types of fish are rich in EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), two fats that are especially important for fertility. In women, EPA and DHA are believed to help regulate hormones, reduce inflammation, promote cervical mucus production, and reduce blood clotting , all of which is beneficial for fertility. EPA and DHA are also believed to be important for helping to prevent miscarriages and preterm labor and for brain and eye development in the fetus. In men, low intake of Omega-3 fats has been associated with poor sperm production and quality. How To Increase Your Intake of Omega-3 Fats One way to increase your intake of EPA and DHA is to eat more fish. However, some organizations, including the National Resources Defense Council, caution against eating farm-raised fish of all types (due to possible contamination with PCBs), and certain types of wild-caught fish, due to the presence of mercury – a toxic heavy metal. A high-quality fish oil supplement is a clean and convenient way to get the EPA and DHA you need. FH-Pro Omega 3 for Men and Women contains oil only from small fish, including herring, mackerel, sardines and anchovies, caught in the cold water of Iceland using sustainable fishing practices. The EPA and DHA-rich oil is then processed in a GMP (good manufacturing practices)-compliant facility to remove heavy metals and pesticides, resulting in premium quality fish oil that is pharmaceutical grade and meets or exceeds all official regulations related to environmental contaminants. Each bottle contains 90 capsules, a 1-month supply. Highlights Key Benefits Contains Premium Icelandic Fish Oil from small fish, such as herring, mackerel, sardines and anchovies FH PRO Provides a daily dose 675 mg of DHA and 225 mg of EPA, the two most beneficial Omega-3 fats for fertility Natural citrus flavor masks any fishy taste and after taste Comes in small, easy to swallow softgels Includes pharmaceutical grade EPA and DHA for maximum purity and quality – heavy metals and pesticides are removed in processing Promotes female fertility by helping to regulate hormones, improve production of cervical fluid, and reduce blood clotting Promotes male fertility by supporting production of high quality sperm Natural – contains no artificial dyes, flavors, or preservatives Ingredients FAQ Here’s our list of most frequently asked questions. If your question is not listed or you need further clarification, please contact us directly. Do I need a prescription from my doctor for FH PRO? No, you do not need a prescription for use. While, FH PRO is a clinical grade dietary supplement, designed to be recommended by fertility specialists as part of a specific fertility protocol, any trying to conceive couple can use the supplement to optimize their reproductive health. What is the daily dosage? We recommend that you take 3 softgels per day, which provides 675 mg of DHA and 225 mg of EPA. Is the gelatin of the capsules vegetarian? No it is not, the gelatin used in the softgel is sourced from beef. As such, neither the fish oil inside nor the capsule is vegetarian. I’m not familiar with the term ART. What does it mean? Assisted reproductive technology (ART) is the technology used to achieve pregnancy in procedures such as fertility medication, artificial insemination, in vitro fertilization and surrogacy. It is reproductive technology used primarily for infertility treatments, and is also known as fertility treatments. Can I use other Fairhaven Health supplements with FH PRO?

One of the biggest games in the world is now available on smartphones around the world thanks to Tencent. The Chinese company’s official port of PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds (PUBG) is now available on iOS and Android worldwide. We tried PUBG on iPhone X when it released in China last month and came away very impressed. It successfully squeezed much of the PC and Xbox game down to a much smaller screen -- and in places looked even better than the Xbox One version of the game. It comes a week after rival Fortnite began inviting players to test its own mobile version. Unlike PUBG, Fortnite will allow players to play across platforms -- meaning iPhone players can kill or be killed by gamers on PC or PlayStation 4. Fortnite recently surpassed pioneer PUBG in popularity. Both games feature 100 players landing on a deserted island filled with weapons, with everyone fighting to be the last person left standing. While PUBG adopts a realistic setting, Fortnite has a more cartoon-like look -- and an emphasis on building structures sets it apart from its rival. But Tencent may find its main competition for PUBG on mobile could come from other Chinese companies. NetEase was quick to copy PUBG and released similar games for smartphone while the original was still on PC. NetEase says just one of its clones, Knives Out, has over 100 million registered players -- far more than the 40 million playing PUBG on PC and Xbox.

Here in Australia, Boxing Day is our "Black Friday." It's the day after Christmas Day and stores have massive sales to help get rid of any post Christmas stock. While it's been a huge event for our department stores for many years, online shopping has made grabbing a bargain much easier (with the added benefit of not having to battle people for the last gift box!). Adelaide has no Mecca Maxima stores, so I had to order the Urban Decay Gwen Stefani Eyeshadow Palette from Mecca online. While this has been available for a while in the US, it was only released on Boxing Day here. I'm IN LOVE with this palette. I feel like it was made for me. I know a lot of people have said there's not much in the way of colour selection, but for someone pale it's the perfect palette. It retails for $95 here in Australia so it's pricier than the other palettes that UD sell, but you really see the amount of thought that went into both the palette and the packaging and shade names. The packaging is gorgeous although it's quite heavy. I can't wait for the rest of the UD x Gwen collection to be released. Lipstick Republic is an Australian online store that sells brands like Sigma, OCC, Lime Crime, Jeffrey Star, Morphe and more. They had 25% off so I put in an order for some products that were on my wishlist. I have previously ordered a Benjabelle Brush Tree from them and I wanted to buy another one. I already have the Mini Brush Tree, which holds 24 eye brushes but I wanted to get a large brush tree that also holds large brushes. I decided on the Sunflower Brush Tree as it holds both small and large brushes. I also ordered the spinner bottom as I don't have it on my other brush tree and I wanted to see if it was more helpful while washing my brushes. I've never been one for Sigma brushes (youTubers pushing their code down my throat makes me side eye the company) but I received a mini E25 Blending Brush in a Bellabox previously and I really loved it, so I ordered a fullsize one from their copper line. I also ordered the Sigma E45 Small Tapered Blending Brush as you can never have enough blending brushes. I thought that this would be great for me as I have small eyes and some blending brushes are bigger than my eyes!! And finally I ordered the Barely Cosmetics Definer Soft Sponge to apply my foundation. I like the shape of this. I haven't tried this yet. I can't wait to see how it compares to my beauty blender and RT sponge. I love Soda & Co's Instagram page of their natural body products and lipbalms. Their packaging is super cute and I love their pictures. When I saw that they had 30% off, I decided to finally make an order. Because I haven't tried their products before, I decided to buy a pack that includes a body wash, body lotion and a sugar scrub that's in an adorable cosmetics bag. I struggled with which scent to choose from (pink lemonade, mint burst or orange splash) but finally decided on pink lemonade as I was worried that the others would smell like bathing in toothpaste or orange juice. I've been using them and the body lotion is the stand out for me. It feels thick when I put it onto my skin but it seems to melt and sink into my skin quickly. The sugar scrub is also amazing for leaving my skin smooth and soft. While I like the body lotion, it's a more subtle scent than the lotion and scrub. I hope that they eventually sell a vanilla or a lavender range as their 3 current scents are quite uplifting and I love using something relaxing at night. Did you purchase anything in the Boxing Day sales? Awesome Boxing Day haul! I didn't buy anything in the sales - trying to cut back!! I have the same brush tree and I love it!! I love my E25 minis but now I want to try the E45! The brush tree is wonderful. It makes washing my brushes so much easier and less hectic. I haven't touched the sales since I'm waiting on Priceline's 40% off skincare sale sometime this month. I'm lusting after that same Benjabelle brush tree you bought! I own that same Sigma tapered blending brush (albeit with the silver ferrule & writing, not the copper) & if I'm honest, I don't like it. Whilst it feels soft at first, after you wash it it becomes scratchy...or at least that's what's happened to me. Not sure what I can do to get it soft again...maybe use some conditioner? The brush tree is fantastic. I'd recommend it!! It makes cleaning your brushes a lot easier and less messy. Ohh that's no good! What do you wash your brushes with? I can't remember what I washed that one with at first, but normally I use a mild shampoo (Moogoo's one) to wash my brushes. I might've used that, but I'm not sure why it made the brush scratchy, unless I was using the wrong product for the type of brush that it is (I think it's synthetic hairs?). Brush trees are so great, aren't they? I wouldn't mind trying that scrub.
It is a beautiful home. A rose blooms in my garden now. Thank you! I thought so, my Dad cooks with it. Do you cook the curry for how many people?
The weather outside doesn't always call for a jacket, sometimes a vest will do the job. Also some boys are like little toasters, hot when others are shivering which makes this puffy vest for boys by Appaman a perfect choice. We, at The Boy's Store, love taht every little detail in this boy's vest is well though out; from the choice of fabric, the tab behind the zipper, down to the logo monkey pull. "Puffy" vests are the perfect in-between warmth providing boy's outerwear.

I think this is one of the most interesting pieces of researching in epidemiology and profound effects on society I have ever seen. I wrote about Kevin Drum’s original work on the connection between lead in the environment and crime rates (I’m not linking to my piece, his piece is linked to in the Brookings piece). This is one of those things where the evidence is so clear, but the conclusion just seems too easy, that contingents in sociology believe it too good to be true. I think it’s fascinating, your mileage may vary.

The city of Augusta is located in Georgia near the state's border with South Carolina. It plays host to the Masters Tournament, the most lauded tournament in professional golf. Augusta is known for the Masters, but there are several other fascinating sides to this city. Here are five things you never knew about Augusta, home of the Masters. Augusta was Georgia’s capital briefly during the American Revolution and then again from 1785 until 1795. In 1788, the Georgia state convention ratified the U.S. Constitution in the city. Georgia was the fourth state to ratify the Constitution and the first in the Deep South. Augusta wasn’t chartered as a city until 1798, so it was actually Georgia’s capital city before officially becoming a city itself. President Woodrow Wilson, who was in office from 1913 to 1921, was born in Virginia but grew up in Augusta. Born in 1856, Wilson lived in Augusta from 1858 to 1870. His father was the pastor of Augusta’s First Presbyterian Church and his family owned a beautiful manse on Seventh Street. Wilson spent the “formative years of his life” in the city. He lived in Augusta during the Civil War and the Reconstruction before going to college in North Carolina. Today, you can visit his boyhood home, which is a National Historic Landmark and the oldest Presidential residence in the state. Guided tours begin on the hour every Thursday through Saturday. Augusta has been either the hometown or burial place of 10 Confederate generals — Brig. Gen. Edward P. Alexander, Maj. Gen. Ambrose R. Wright and Gen. Marcellus A. Stovall, among others. “When the South needed generals during the Civil War, it often turned to Augustans,” the Augusta Chronicle says. Today, you can see monuments all over the city that have been dedicated to these men. The Masters wasn’t always called the Masters; the title didn’t come about until 1939. The tournament began in 1934 and was originally known as the Augusta National Invitational. That name didn’t sound quite prestigious enough, however — so in 1939, the name was changed to the Masters. The first-in-flight brothers from North Carolina brought their airplanes to Georgia. The Wright Flying School was in business from 1910 to 1916. During that time, it taught 119 people to fly Wright airplanes. The main location of the school was in Alabama and then moved to Ohio. Trying to take advantage of the warm winters in the South, the Wrights also opened a seasonal facility in Augusta in 1911. It was run by Frank Coffyn, an aviator who was a member of the Wright Exhibition Team after the Wright brothers taught him to fly.

F1600 Formula F Championship Series alum Aaron Telitz claimed two victories for the Team USA Scholarship and Cliff Dempsey Racing at this weekend’s 43rd annual Formula Ford Festival at Brands Hatch, but fell short of the ultimate prize when he spun into the gravel trap while challenging for the lead in the Final. Teammate Michai Stephens, 22, from Evanston, Ill., once again was struck by misfortune in his Semi Final race this morning and was unable to qualify for the Final. Stephens had driven impressively to work his way from 25th on the grid to 12th, only to be forced off the road when veteran driver Rick Morris made a rare mistake while Stephens was in the process of passing him around the outside at Clearways. Telitz, 22, from Birchwood, Wis., put on another clinic during his Semi Final round. He made an exemplary start from the pole and led all 15 laps to ensure a place on the front row of the grid for the 20-lap Grand Final. He had to be content with the outside position, due to the fact his Semi Final had been interrupted by two Safety Car periods which ensured a slower average speed than Semi Final 2. Undeterred, Telitz made a good start and immediately began to pressurize race leader Jonny McMullan. On Lap 4, Telitz carried more momentum onto the Brabham Straight and drafted to the left of McMullan on the undulating approach to the first corner, Paddock Hill Bend. The pair ran side-by-side toward the apex of the turn, whereupon Telitz’s car just got away from him and he performed a lazy spin into the gravel trap, from which there was no escape. Telitz and Stephens will now regroup and return to action on Thursday at Silverstone for two more days of testing prior to next weekend’s Walter Hayes Trophy event for which over 100 Formula Ford cars are currently entered.
It sounds nice doesn't it? I read it in a fanfiction and tried to find out where it was from but failed. I didn't want to lose the quote either so here it is! Mmn, there's so much I want to write about but I don't feel like writing about anything. I guess this entry shall just be a quote. This page was loaded Apr 20th 2019, 12:20 am GMT.

Personally speaking, Bringing It All Back Home is the only Dylan album (thatI’ve heard) that I can sit through from beginning to end. I just don’t ‘get’ him…….I’ll get my coat. What a buzz to log on and see your review of the Distant Vocies gig. I’m lucky enough to be involved with Vox Liminis up here in Glasgow, and I’m so glad you enjoyed the concert DFB. I know….it was kind of surreal. Apparently The Smiths played there too, but I missed that one. Chuck Berry. My first ever gig. 1982(ish). In of all places, Irvine Magnum. Me 17 with a hall full of Teds (where did they come from?). An hour with a pick up band and then off on the dot. I thought both The Singer and Bad Penny Blues were just crying out for a TV adaptation. I’ll need to check out Weirdo now…. The Singer & Bad Penny Blues by Cathi Unsworth. AC/DC. Whole Lotta Rosie live at the Glasgow Apollo. Amen. Cheers. Thanks for the heads up. I missed that release first time around. Thanks Vulpes. Both your enthusiasm and your donation are very much appreciated. I’m a rare poster on here, but I’d like to ask for your help. Voxliminis is a Glasgow based charity, which helps support individuals (and their families) involved in the criminal justice system in Scotland. No, you’re not alone. Speaking as an old school R.E.M. nut, I recall being really puzzled/disappointed/upset even when I first heard OOT back in 1991. It just didn’t sound like R.E.M. to me. From memory the b sides from the OOT album weren’t that inspiring (mostly live tracks from The Green tour if I recall).
When it comes to determining total cost of ownership (TCO), it is vital for organisations to be able to place a single value on the complete lifecycle of a capital purchase. In the retail space, this means implementing a robust and repeatable system that enables the business to calculate the TCO of its IT, Logistics and Property investments. As one of South Africa’s largest retailers, the Foschini Group (TFG) found that the size and complexity of its businesses required a particularly robust, granular model to charge back the shared service costs for its various brands. The Foschini Group currently offers an impressive portfolio of 28 retail brands covering clothing and footwear (including brands such as Foschini, Markham, Exact and Due South), jewellery (Sterns, American Swiss, Mat &May), sportswear (Sportscene, and Totalsports) and homeware (@home, @homelivingspace) and retails through over 2 600 stores across sub-Saharan Africa. It was essential for TFG to gain visibility into a more accurate return on capital employed (ROCE) per brand, such as determining Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) after shared services cost allocations for each of the 28 brands, rather than relying on this metric at a consolidated Group level alone, explains Marlize van der Westhuizen, Head of Finance: Infotec and Logistics Divisions at TFG. “Since TFG had no real cost transparency solution and a very limited charge-back model to its various brands, the group clearly required not only the right solution, but also the relevant expertise to introduce an effective cost transparency discipline into the enterprise. For this, we turned to Magic Orange, which was able to assist us with both consulting services and the actual implementation of the chosen solution,” she says. “The first requirement was to create a complete product and service catalogue, which the Magic Orange team assisted to build from scratch, based on relevant business input from the various areas in scope. Furthermore, the existing models for the allocation of costs were very limited and not consistently based on operational drivers. This meant that every product and service required a driver to be sourced and incorporated into the Magic Orange model. In addition to the development of these drivers, the implementation included training ensuring employees understood both the nature and fairness of the drivers.,” explains Malcolm Stewart, Business Development Manager at Magic Orange. “The first phase focused on the customer’s IT and Logistics budget stack – an individual stack that nonetheless had a substantial budget. This core model was delivered in a mere eight weeks, despite being driven from a zero base,” Stewart states. Van der Westhuizen adds that reciprocal charging was properly modelled and catered for, and fully loaded and accurate TCOs for products and services across the organisation were also made available. Finally, scenario modelling was also implemented, which enabled multiple scenarios, including a range of different budgets, actuals and forecast data, to be loaded. This will assist TFG in making both strategic and tactical decisions. “In the end though, the two biggest game changers for us were the manner in which Magic Orange brought together the cost transparency and a credible recharge model based on consumption of services opposed to just a cost allocation model. This will further assist us in optimizing costs and an important step to calculate ROCE at a brand level. The Magic Orange team fully delivered on our challenges and exceeded our expectation in the way their experts understand and care for our business success,” concludes van der Westhuizen.
Saturday morning, we hoped in a rented white Beetle for Hallstatt from Munich. Still half asleep, two and a half hours later, we arrived in the quiet small Austrian town. Lots of tourists were strolling along the steep paths. Most of the shops were closed, only few cafés and restaurants were welcoming passerby. Along the Hallstätter lake, the lovely traditional houses are agglomerated in random patterns on an abrupt slope. Like in most European villages, a church overlooks the town. The lovely sunny weather lead us on a stroll between the tight alleys and steep stairs. Of course, the main attraction of the Hallstatt is its gorgeous lake and surrounding mountains. The winter scenery was very impressive to see. Every point of view was breathtaking. I can’t imagine how fall and summer must be in this charming Austrian town. Every time I have the opportunity to visit Paris, I feel like it is like a living dream. Its magic emanates from the historic buildings, cobble streets, chic restaurants and sumptuous monuments. A real treat for any history, art or architecture lovers. Ooohh and the food. I don’t need to say more. The first day I went to Centre Pompidou for the Tadao Ando exhibition and the general collections of modern art. The center is already a great piece of work showing its technical systems and structure as part of its architecture design. Inside, the forum connects the accesses to galleries together. The showcased artworks include works from Picasso, Braque, Cézanne, Matisse, and so on. A spontaneous night stroll lead us to the beautifully decorated Hôtel de ville and Cathédrale Notre-Dame. Although the nights were cold and windy, a lot of people were taking advantage of the Christmas lights and ambiance. The holidays season is probably the peak time for the metropolis. Walking in the streets is a real delight to the eyes with all the festive lights hanging above your heads. The Champs-Élysées was blushing in red from the start to the end. The next morning, we walked to my favorite spot which is la Seine, the famous river flowing through the city. The thing I noticed and love about these pictures of the river is the perfect harmony between all the elements, the historical buildings, the rocks, the old bridges. They seem to tell the same kind of story of a place we read so much about in books and movies. On Sunday evening, we drove to Versailles with our bags filled with sandwiches and snacks. Unfortunately, the waiting line was unbelievably long so we decided to stroll around the gardens instead. Near the West coast of France, Nantes is a charming city that preserved its historic culture through its architecture and its local gastronomy. With the holidays, the downtown area is lit up with Christmas markets and lights above almost every street. From Munich, my 2-hours flight brought me directly to the modest airport of Nantes at night. The first days were meant to just stay home and recharge. The city lays in the region of Loire-Atlantique which harbours a lot of castles from as far as the Renaissance period. The area is also famous for its crêpes bretonnes, seafood, pastries like le nantais, and so on. Obviously, I took the opportunity to gain some weight and empty the wallet. Spending Christmas here was quite lovely for the change of scenery and for the French cuisine. And seeing my relatives again felt good to my soul (even through the usual family drama during the holidays ;) ).

Apparently when you have a blog, one of the obligatory posts at the end of each year is some sort of year in review. I’m going to do a couple things. First, I’m going to highlight the top 10 posts from the past year. By that, I mean the most clicked-on posts according to the stat counter. I have no idea if objectively they are the “top” posts. This is an important topic, to be sure, but Top 10? Okay. 9. My ______ Isn’t Producing! What’s Wrong? This is definitely one of the most common questions we get every year. People want fresh veggies as soon as possible, and it’s perturbing when they don’t appear right away! 8. What is the “Best” Tomato to Plant? Unfortunately, I don’t think anyone reading this post got their question answered, since I essentially told them that they are asking the wrong question. First, determine what you value in a tomato plant, then pick the plant that fits! 7. What’s Eating the Spinach? I know no one got a satisfactory answer from this post when they visited, because we never really determined what was eating our spinach either. A closeup picture of the tomato trellis we used in the Family of 4 Garden. I think this post is hanging on the coat-tails of one of the top 5 posts. 5. My Tomato is Rotting! Ah, Blossom End Rot, the disease that is not a disease. Such a ghastly looking tomato it causes too! Okay, I’ll guarantee you that people ended up on this post because they were searching for “fuzzy white caterpillar.” I hope they weren’t looking for anything other than pictures of cute, fuzzy white caterpillars. FYI, they are probably some type of tussock moth, but I’m not a bug girl, so don’t quote me on that. The Family of 4 Garden and the plan for the garden that launched this whole blog project! What’s not to love about big, orange, gooey, gloppy balls of stuff that show up on cedar trees in the rainy weather of spring? Well, a lot, actually. They don’t hurt the cedar trees, but I’m not a fan of what they do to apples! The most popular post for the year: a look at the 3 different methods of training and trellising tomatoes that we used in the Demonstration Garden this summer! There you have it! I’ll be back after the New Year to start sharing our plans for the 2010 Demonstration Garden. Not much going on in the garden this week, and there probably won’t be for a few weeks. You’ll have to excuse me if all I get around to for the next few weeks is a couple posts here and there. Next Friday is Christmas! Can you believe it? Things will start happening again by the end of January, when we start planning the garden for next year! This week I’m reviewing the Southern Exposure Seed Exchange Catalog. SESE is a lot like Seed Savers Exchange, except, well…they’re Southern! They are based in Virginia, and a lot of their seed growers also reside in the south. The reason this is important, is their seeds are grown and saved in hot, humid regions, so they are likely well-adapted to dealing with our hot climate. It might be interesting to try the same varieties from both Seed Savers and Southern Exposure just to see if there are any differences in how they perform for us here in Kansas. SESE has a number of “new” items this year, but I’m mostly going to highlight some varieties that they have, but might be hard to find elsewhere. Purple Podded Yard Long Bean – This pole bean is a type of asparagus bean, or Chinese yard long bean. This particular bean is a very vigorous grower and has gorgeous dark purple beans that retain the purple color when stir-fried. You need a big trellis! Pole Lima Beans – SESE has a nice selection of Pole Lima Beans that are hard to find otherwise. Black Knight Butterbean is a new variety that sounds intriguing. Violet’s Multi-Colored Butterbean is hilarious to grow, because every pod yields different colored beans. I’ve always thought it would be fun to try to isolate and breed individual varieties out of this variety. Tashkent French Marigold – Okay, this seems like a really interesting French Marigold variety, but I have to be honest that it is mostly intriguing to me because it was found in Uzbekistan, and I find Uzbekistan an intriguing country. It is also supposedly sweet smelling, rather than astringent like most marigolds. Asian Tempest Garlic – What’s not to love with a name like Asian Tempest? This is a very hot garlic raw, but mellow after roasting. Of course, we are past the planting window for garlic now, but keep it in mind for next year! Grey Griselle Shallot – SESE is one of the only sources I’ve found in the U.S. for French Grey Shallots. Prized for French cooking, some consider these shallots the only “true” shallot. As with the garlic, we are past the planting time for this year. Have a great weekend! Get all that Christmas shopping done! I finally received my 2010 Johnny’s catalog this week. Not that I’m impatient or anything, but they have had their new 2010 items up on their brand new, sparkly website for a couple weeks now. I had to work really hard to wait to do this review until I actually had a catalog. So, without further ado, here are 5 interesting items from their catalog this year. ‘Albion’ Strawberry – This is a day-neutral (potential to fruit from spring to frost, but often doesn’t in the middle of the hot summer here), that has a great flavor. I tried these out in Oregon and found them quite delicious. They also have good disease resistance, not to mention that perfect strawberry shape. ‘Tempo’ Artichoke – A purple globe artichoke that produces in only 100 days, so it can be grown as an annual. I’m curious to see how well it tolerates our heat. ‘Purple Pak’ & ‘Deep Purple’ Carrots – This whole purple carrot business is making me a little dizzy. Last year they had ‘Purple Rain’ which is nowhere to be seen this year, and ‘Deep Purple’ was on the website, but had a seed failure. Now there is ‘Purple Pak’ and ‘Deep Purple’ is apparently in stock. Still, I have a fondness for purple carrots, so I doubt I’ll be able to resist. Ice Plant – Buried in the Micro Mix Varieties is this gem. Ice plants are frequently grown as ornamentals, but their succulent leaves are also edible. They have juicy leaves that are flavored with a hint of saltiness and lemon. ‘Red Cardinal’ Spinach – This is a replacement for the ‘Bordeaux’ Spinach that we had out in the garden this year. It has more oval leaves than ‘Bordeaux’ and a more upright habit. It also has red stems and veins. ‘Sprite’ Honeydew – This isn’t exactly new, but it is new to Johnny’s. You might have seen the “Sprite” honeydew melons in grocery stores, but now you can grow them at home! These are little, 1 lb. melons with white flesh. The wintery weather followed by cold temperatures today has frozen the garden pretty solid. The spinach leaves are like ice cubes. They will probably thaw out in a couple days when it is warmer and do just fine. In fact, this picture was from yesterday morning, and even this afternoon, they are thawing out. Likewise the Swiss Chard…while the bigger leaves are probably toast, the young central leaves will probably keep growing if it warms up again. The Brussels Sprouts have reached the end of their lives…not because they can’t take the cold, but because I sawed them off this afternoon. I sawed them off with a pruning saw. Rather interesting – the center of the stems was hollow. I don’t know if this was just the result of normal growth or if some insect had bored in. The plants are frozen solid, but they should thaw out just fine in the corner of my office. I’ll snap the sprouts off in a day or two.
The huge VKAC RACIN BISON V2 excels in its awesome power system which makes wheelie a piece of cake. It is capable of handling rugged roads thanks to the design of low center of mass. Much like the wild animal, it offers you unprecedented high performance! The HobbyWing MXA10 RTR 120A ESC and 3670 high-torque motor coordinate perfectly, in addition, the LiPo battery has a 25C high discharge rate. The system is so powerful that it can achieve wheelie easily. When entering into curved racing tracks, the truck winds its way by slowing down the inner wheels and quickening the outer ones. The center of gravity of the vehicle is very low, which significantly diminishes the possibility of rolling and diving, increases its flexibility, and evenly distributes its weight on the four wheels. The shock absorber at the front and rear of the chassis respond well to different road conditions and buffer the vibration perfectly. Note: motor color will be randomly sent. The transmitter has been upgraded.

Dr. Bethea speaks of a minimally invasive approach to treating patients. Dr. Bethea is the founder of Greensboro Rejuvenation, an integrative health and wellness practice that specializes in regenerative medicine, using platelet-rich plasma (PRP), stem cells and other natural methods for wellness. Her practice takes a non-operative, non-opioid approach, with the focus on her patients’ overall long-term health. Greensboro Rejuvenation also offers natural hormone replacement therapy, natural weight loss and nutritional IV supplementation. A Thomasville native, Dr. Bethea grew up in High Point and Greensboro before her family relocated to West Virginia. She returned to the Tar Heel State in 1992. As a medical student at East Carolina University, she wanted to be a surgeon, and after graduating in 2001, completed her general surgery internship in Syracuse, N.Y. In 2005, she completed her PM&R residency as chief resident at Sinai Hospital (University of Maryland) in Baltimore. Dr. Bethea is also fellowship trained in interventional spine and joint pain management and worked for a neurosurgical practice for three years before opening her own practice in Reidsville. In 2014 she moved that practice to Greensboro. Platelet-rich plasma treatment, a natural procedure using the patient’s own blood, is one of the more rewarding services Dr. Bethea offers her patients. It is recommended for healing damaged or injured tissues. PRP involves drawing blood from a patient, spinning it in a centrifuge, and extracting the plasma and platelets from the whole blood, which are injected back into the painful, injured areas, on the same day. One of her patients, Ann Hardee of Greensboro, a 69-year-old yoga instructor and real estate agent, agrees. “Dr. Bethea evaluated my injury and injected PRP in February 2017. I felt immediate relief, and over the next eight weeks, the pain completely disappeared. I would repeat this treatment again and again over surgery if the pain ever returned. I have recommended this treatment to others as an amazing alternative to surgery,” she says. For more information, visit GSORejuvenation.com.

The results of operations for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for a full year or of future operations. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America were omitted pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The accompanying consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the Company’s fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. Certain amounts previously presented in the consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. During the three months ended December 31, 2015, the Company elected to early adopt Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2015-17-Income Taxes (Topic 740) requiring all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as non-current on the balance sheet. The purpose of this adoption was to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes. The accompanying balance sheet as of September 30, 2015 has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the adoption of this standard. The effect of the adjustment at September 30, 2015 was a $6.4 million decrease in current assets, a $10,000 decrease in current liabilities, a $3.0 million increase in non-current deferred tax assets and a $3.4 million decrease in non-current deferred tax liabilities. Such reclassification had no effect on our previously reported net loss, stockholders’ equity or cash flows. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company considers many factors in selecting appropriate operational and financial accounting policies and controls, and in developing the estimates and assumptions that are used in the preparation of these financial statements. The Company continually evaluates its estimates, including those related to bad debt reserves, inventory obsolescence reserves, self-insurance reserves, product warranty reserves, impairment of long-lived assets and deferred income tax assets. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities which are not readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions or assumptions. The Company’s long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. The impairment review, if necessary, includes a comparison of expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) to be generated by an asset group with the associated carrying value of the related assets. If the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the expected future cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value. At June 30, 2016, management reviewed the recoverability of the carrying value of the Company’s long-lived assets based on future undiscounted cash flows and determined that the carrying value of certain rental assets exceeded the expected future cash flows. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $1.0 million in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2016. No such impairment of remaining long-lived assets was necessary as the expected future cash flows exceeded the carrying value of the assets. The Company primarily derives revenue from the sale of its manufactured products, including revenue derived from the sale of its manufactured rental equipment. In addition, the Company generates revenue from the short-term rental under operating leases of its manufactured products. The Company recognizes revenue from product sales, including the sale of used rental equipment, when (i) title passes to the customer, (ii) the customer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership, (iii) the product sales price has been determined, (iv) collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured, and (v) product delivery occurs as directed by the customer. Except for certain of the Company’s reservoir characterization products, the Company’s products are generally sold without any customer acceptance provisions and the Company’s standard terms of sale do not allow customers to return products for credit. The Company recognizes rental revenue as earned over the rental period. Rentals of the Company’s equipment generally range from daily rentals to rental periods of up to six months or longer. Revenue from engineering services is recognized as services are rendered over the duration of a project, or as billed on a per hour basis. Field service revenue is recognized when services are rendered and is generally priced on a per day rate. immediate recognition of estimated credit losses expected to occur for most financial assets and certain other instruments. For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, the losses will be recognized as allowances rather than reductions in the amortized cost of the securities. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption for fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2018 is permitted. Entities will apply the standard’s provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first effective reporting period. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material effect upon its consolidated financial statements. In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance to simplify key components of employee share-based payment accounting. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions are simplified, including: (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on the statement of cash flows. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material effect upon its consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance requiring a lessee to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. Consistent with current GAAP, the recognition, measurement and presentation of expense and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease. However, unlike current GAAP, which requires only capital leases to be recognized on the balance sheet, this new guidance will require both types of leases to be recognized on the balance sheet. The guidance also requires disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users to better understand the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. These disclosures include qualitative and quantitative requirements, providing additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2018 and is to be applied using the modified retrospective approach. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material effect upon its consolidated financial statements. In July 2015, the FASB issued guidance requiring management to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period and should be applied retrospectively, with early application permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. In August 2014, the FASB issued guidance requiring management to evaluate whether there are conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide disclosures in certain circumstances. The new guidance was issued to reduce diversity in the timing and content of footnote disclosures. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material effect upon its consolidated financial statements. In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance requiring entities to recognize revenue from contracts with customers by applying a five-step model in accordance with the core principle to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, this guidance specifies the accounting for some costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer and expands disclosure requirements for revenue recognition. In August 2015, the FASB issued guidance deferring the effective date of this guidance to annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods therein. Entities have the option to adopt this guidance either retrospectively or through a modified retrospective transition method. This new standard will supersede existing revenue guidance and affect the Company's revenue recognition process and the presentations or disclosures of the Company's consolidated financial statements and footnotes. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements. At June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, the Company’s Canadian subsidiary had $27.5 million and $28.1 million, respectively, of Canadian dollar denominated intercompany accounts payable owed to one of the Company’s U.S. subsidiaries. In order to mitigate its exposure to movements in foreign currency rates between the U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar, the Company routinely enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of its exposure to changes in the value of the Canadian dollar. Approximately $3.3 million of these Canadian dollar denominated intercompany accounts payable are considered by management to be of a short-term nature whereby the appreciation or devaluation of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar will result in a gain or loss, respectively, to the consolidated statement of operations. The Company considers the remaining $24.2 million Canadian dollar denominated intercompany accounts payable to be of a long-term nature and whereby settlement is not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future; therefore, any resulting foreign exchange gains and losses are reported in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of other comprehensive income in accordance with ASC 830 “Foreign Currency Matters”. In June 2016, the Company entered into a $3.0 million 90-day hedge contract with a United States bank to hedge a portion of its short-term Canadian dollar foreign exchange rate exposure. This contract reduces the impact on cash flows from movements in the Canadian dollar/U.S. dollar currency exchange rate, but has not been designated as a hedge for accounting purposes. At June 30, 2016, the fair value of this contract was a liability of $11,000. equivalents, trade and other receivables and accounts payable, the carrying amounts approximate fair value on the respective balance sheet dates. The Company applies fair value techniques on a non-recurring basis in evaluating potential impairment losses related to long-lived assets. During the nine months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company made non-cash inventory transfers of $3.0 million and $4.8 million, respectively, to its rental equipment fleet. Raw materials include semi-finished goods and component parts totaling $52.5 million and $48.4 million, respectively, at June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015. The Company had no long-term debt outstanding at June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015. On March 2, 2011, the Company entered into a credit agreement with Frost Bank with borrowing availability of $50.0 million (the “Credit Agreement”). On May 4, 2015, the Company amended the Credit Agreement which reduced its borrowing availability to $30.0 million with amounts available for borrowing determined by a borrowing base. Under the amendments to the Credit Agreement, the borrowing base is determined based upon certain of the Company’s and its U.S. subsidiaries’ assets which include (i) 80% of certain accounts receivable plus (ii) 50% of certain notes receivable (such result not to exceed $10 million) plus (iii) 25% of certain inventories (excluding work-in-process inventories). As of June 30, 2016, the Company’s borrowing base was $35.3 million resulting in borrowing availability of $30.0 million less $0.5 million of outstanding letters of credit. The Company’s domestic subsidiaries have guaranteed the obligations of the Company under the Credit Agreement and such subsidiaries have secured their obligations under such guarantees by the pledge of substantially all of the assets of such subsidiaries, except real property assets. The Credit Agreement expires on May 4, 2018 and all borrowed funds are due and payable at that time. The Company is required to make monthly interest payments on borrowed funds. The Credit Agreement as amended limits the incurrence of additional indebtedness, requires the maintenance of a single financial ratio that compares certain of the Company’s assets to certain of its liabilities, restricts the Company and its subsidiaries’ ability to pay cash dividends and contains other covenants customary in agreements of this type. The interest rate for borrowings under the Credit Agreement as amended is based on the Wall Street Journal prime rate, which was 3.50% at June 30, 2016. At June 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement. During the nine months ended June 30, 2016, the Company issued 182,400 shares of restricted stock under its 2014 Long Term Incentive Plan, as amended (the “Plan”). The weighted average grant date fair value of the restricted stock was $14.84 per share. The grant date fair value of these awards was $2.7 million, which will be charged to expense over the next four years as the restrictions lapse. Compensation expense for restricted stock awards was determined based on the closing market price of the Company’s stock on the date of grant applied to the total number of shares that are anticipated to fully vest. Recipients of restricted stock awards are entitled to vote such shares and are entitled to dividends, if paid. During the nine months ended June 30, 2016, the Company also issued 69,300 nonqualified stock options under the Plan. The options issued are based upon three tiers, each with separate market and service based vesting conditions. Market based vesting conditions are based on achieving a specified market return on the Company’s stock price. Compensation expense for the nonqualified stock option awards was determined based on a Monte Carlo simulation, which incorporates the possibility that the market conditions may not be satisfied. The weighted average grant date fair value of the options issued was determined to be $5.96 per option resulting in unrecognized compensation costs of $0.4 million, which will be charged to expense over the requisite service period of the options, ranging from 18 to 36 months. As of June 30, 2016, the Company had unrecognized compensation expense of $8.1 million relating to restricted stock awards. This unrecognized compensation expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.8 years. In addition, the Company had $0.3 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to nonqualified stock option awards which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.7 years. As of June 30, 2016, a total of 276,150 shares of restricted stock and 159,000 nonqualified stock options shares were outstanding. For the calculation of diluted loss per share for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, 159,000 stock options and 89,700 stock options, respectively, were excluded in the calculation of weighted average shares outstanding as a result of their impact being antidilutive.

My first memory of Eero Saarinen‘s work was going to the top of St. Louis’ Gateway Arch in June 1970, when I was 10 years old. Having grown up in suburban Detroit, I later remember gazing at the futuristic looking Design Dome and Watertower at the General Motors Technical Center in Warren, Michigan. The Design Dome at the General Motors Technical Center in Warren, Michigan opened in 1955. The TWA Flight Center opened in 1962 as the original terminal designed by Eero Saarinen for Trans World Airlines at New York City’s John F. Kennedy International Airport.

A serene elegance overflows from this timeless Spanish beauty in the Hollywood Hills. Situated at the end of a cul-de-sac at the foot of Runyon Canyon Park, it’s evident that something special awaits as you enter the property through concrete arches and a custom wrought iron gate. Besides its dramatic presence, the home is loaded with architectural details that are only found in homes from a bygone era. A rotunda entry with inlaid polished wood floors and stenciled ceiling. The hardwood floors throughout the house are impeccable. It's as though they've never come in contact with the sole of a shoe in their 86 years. The doors and windows throughout this home are beautiful, and in some cases quite unique. The French doors in the living room open to a large courtyard. The home features a family Room, large formal dining room with views, a tower room, a 2-room staff wing and guest apartment with large terrace. The second floor has five bedrooms. The master suite has city views and a generously sized dressing room. Check out the oval window. Sweet, isn't it? One of the more unique features I've seen is this space that appears to be a sort of prayer vestibule. The detail of its design is extraordinary. The outdoor area in the back has three distinct levels. On the main floor is a private and beautifully tiled courtyard. At the second level of the backyard is this beautiful pool and a terrace.. On the uppermost level of the back yard is a long pergola with that sits high above the house and commands unobstructed views of the city and beyond.

After trying to get a balance between textures and line work I feel this is working much better than the originals. I redid the line work and background. Harsher shadows and a little glow, more subtle color shifts hopefully looking a bit better. Speed is still a problem as a lot of layers and time spent trying to make this look quick and fluid.
This wall mural is the first thing people see when they enter Red Chalk Studios. Red Chalk is a multi-disciplinary creative agency in Virginia Beach. The mural started out as a chalk mural that we designed and lettered but they soon wanted to make it permanent installation. So we painted it on the wall.

I’m a workaholic. I work most of the time and have to keep myself from squeezing in a task in my spare moments. Yet, today I’ve decided I’m not going to do anything, except rest, relax, and recharge. And, you know what? So far, it has been great. My day has been filled with laying on the coach, watching T.V., and eating leftovers. The only “work” I have done has been online shopping. The beauty of being lazy is that it helps a person become a better person, because you are able to refuel and ease some of your stress. It is a type of self-care that everyone needs to do. While you may be spending hours in store lines today, make sure to take some time being lazy and enjoying the day. Trust me, you’ll feel better and stronger to take on the holiday chaos. I’m a middle school teacher, who spends her free time doing DIY projects, reading, and relaxing. Welcome to my journey!
* I’m not sure who’s telling the truth here (although I have my suspicions), but it looks like the governor’s people are more than hinting that Comptroller Hynes is trying to force a budget crisis. On the other hand, it might be assumed that the governor’s office is keeping the squeeze on Medicaid providers in order to prod them into backing his GRT plan, which would provide lots of cashola. The Blagojevich administration missed a chance to pay $650 million in Medicaid bills in early April, despite a suggestion to act from Comptroller Dan Hynes’ office, the agency said Tuesday. Knowles said the payment plan relied on money borrowed short term to kick-start an assessment program that taxes hospitals to obtain additional federal money to treat Medicaid patients. However, the legislature still hasn’t approved a supplemental spending bill needed to fully implement the hospital assessment program. The man behind the so-called tax-swap proposal to fund Illinois schools said Tuesday night that McHenry County state legislators were acting neither fairly nor morally in rejecting his measure. You were on that bus with him. Does he seem capable of pulling these stunts? Blagojevich likes to fight and bully, while Hynes is as vanilla as me but comes off as meek. Blagojevich will tell you anything, while Hynes seems very straight-forward. I’d rather believe Hynes over Blagojevich. But then again, Blagojevich has proved repeatedly that no one should believe anything he says. Bottom line - tough noogies. The Democrats renominated Blagojevich knowing fully well his numerous shortcomings and scandals. When Blagojevich is done playing with Illinois, the Illinois Democratic Party should be held accountable for the damage done. Martire’s board includes AFSCME, IFT and AFL-CIO reps. That says more than any speech Ralph gives about where he’s coming from. At least the GRT would provide some health insurance. Ralph wants to give most of our money to the schools regardless of actual education bureaucracy performance, plus some tasty bites of the money pie to unionized state government. It’s all bait and switch. Bait us with a little property tax relief into a permanent income tax increase without mentioning that the property tax relief won’t be much and won’t last long. It doesn’t surprise me that Hynes would try to get some press at Blagojevich’s expense. He did it many times in the first term. This is just another example of Hynes using the governor to get himself some positive press. Isnt it time to combine the offices of comptroller and treasurer anyway? Why do we have these unnecessary constitutional offices? We could probably do away with the Lt. Governor for that matter. What real purpose does the Lt. Gov serve? Hynes seems to relativity honest and straight talking, unlike Governor Blagojevich, so I would believe Hynes over Blagojevich. Particular when you take some of the latter’s political stunts into account and the history of not paying Medicaid bills. Usually the HFS folks are the ones who are disingenuous about Medicaid payments, but in this case, HFS probably had little choice but to conserve appropriations for the balance of the fiscal year in order to be able to pay their hardship providers. The Comptroller was correct in saying that there was a period of enhanced liquidity due to the proceeds from the hospital assessment. However, HFS simply didn’t have the appropriation reserves necessary to utilize it. I think the Comptroller was trying to call out the Governor on the Medicaid deficit, knowing that at this point in the fiscal year, HFS couldn’t respond. For the love of God. Pay these people already! They have waited long enough. What are you waiting for? A good day for a press release to announce that you are graciously repaying a debt that you owe. Start by paying the people who have been waiting the longest and start now. Morons. we must not have updated our website recently enough. Former AG Jim Ryan joined our Board a couple of months ago.
Every two years, the Mesilla Valley MPO is required to develop a new Transportation Improvement Program (TIP). The TIP outlines the 6-year program for funding the various transportation projects that are scheduled to receive federal or selected state funds within the Mesilla Valley MPO area. The Open Call for Projects for the 2020 – 2025 TIP commenced on November 19, 2018 and concluded on February 22, 2019. The Mesilla Valley MPO Public Participation Plan requires that the MPO have a 30 day public comment period before the MPO Policy Committee considers the new TIP for adoption. That public comment period commenced on April 4, 2019 at the regularly scheduled Technical Advisory Meeting. MPO Staff intends to take the TIP to the MPO Policy Committee for action on May 8, 2019. The current draft of the Mesilla Valley MPO 2020 – 2025 TIP is available here.

We all know how good oats are. Oats in a jar, oats with nut butter, oat cookies, oats in granola, oats in smoothies and stovetop oats. This time, I wanted to fluff up my oats. I mean really puff those babies up and give them a big head like they deserve. Make your oatmeal on the stovetop as usual. I used part milk, water and honey vanilla flavored coffee creamer and McCann’s Steel Cut Irish Oatmeal. Beat 4 egg whites, cream of tartar and cinnamon in a medium bowl on high speed until stiff peaks form. When there is just a little bit of liquid left in your oatmeal on the stovetop, fold in the beaten egg whites and continue to stir while cooking on medium low heat for 3-5 minutes. Keep stirring until oatmeal gets as thick as you like it. Spoon into a bowl and serve! Add sweetener or vanilla/almond extract if desired to flavor your fluffy oats! I used part water, part skim milk and part honey vanilla flavored coffee cream liquid as the base for my bowl of oats. Can you see the egg whites in the oats? Puffed it up alright! I should have drizzled on some nut butter or something, but this just tasted really good as is! I have OATMEAL fever. Do you? I love pomegranates on my oats! I know there are a ton of toppings to put on a bowl of oats, but if you could only choose 1 thing to put on your oatmeal bowl, what would it be? This entry was posted in Deliciousness and tagged Egg whites, oatmeal. Bookmark the permalink. Wow! I never would’ve thought about egg whites in oatmeal. Sounds delicious! PB definitely my topping of choice. I like oats but really only eat them on the weekend when I have time to make it on the stovetop. I’ve heard about eggwhites in oatmeal but it kinda skeeves me out when I’ve heard about it. But now I see the visual and yours are gorgeous! I’m loving the fluff idea! Is the egg whites taste strong? Or can you not taste them? I didn’t really taste them! would have never thought of that! does it taste pretty different from regular oatmeal? So much better than regular oatmeal!
Data management can seem daunting, especially when you’re working with a granting body or laboratory that has stringent requirements for documentation, preservation, and accessibility. At the Comparative Cognition Lab at Illinois Wesleyan University, the IR has become a critical part of the research process. Learn how Dr. Ellen Furlong and her students use the IR as a data-management tool to facilitate research examining the similarities and differences between human and animal reasoning and decision-making. In this webinar, Dr. Furlong joins forces with IR manager Stephanie Davis-Kahl and a student researcher to give us a view into the lab’s research, the importance of ethics and data documentation in the field, and finally how the lab uses the IR as both a research and teaching tool that trains students in best practices for data management.

Marks & Spencer is to open a chain of banks, backed by HSBC. The first branch is scheduled to open next month inside its Marble Arch flagship store. Just three years after the banking crisis sparked off one of the worst global recessions ever, the vast majority of savers still do not believe financial institutions are transparent about what they do with their money. Research from Triodos Bank – a credit provider that only lends to green and ethical organisations – showed just three per cent of customers believe banks are transparent about what happens to their funds once they are deposited. Just over half of the respondents said they would change banks if they knew their money was being lent to controversial industries. Over a third said they have issues with funding intensive animal farming, while 85 per cent believed more information should be freely available about what happens to money saved. Charles Middleton, managing director at Triodos Bank said the figures made it clear that savers are "genuinely concerned" about where their deposits go. "The banking sector as a whole must acknowledge customers' interest in the use of money and properly consider the role that its power and influence can play in acting for positive change. "UK consumers want and deserve a full understanding of where their money is being invested and lent, so they can make informed decisions about where to deposit their savings," he added.

When I visited New Zealand in 2015, I spent the majority of my time in Christchurch. The primary reason for my trip to the area was to attend a Geocaching Mega Event in the area known as Kaiapoi. I spent nine days in and around Christchurch exploring the city and the countryside. I will cover most of the main area’s I visited in Christchurch in this post. However, there are a couple of posts that I have previously shared a little about my time in Christchurch. I will list them below if you want to read more about my time in Christchurch. I visited Hagley Park on numerous occasions while in Christchurch, both as a place to walk and to find a few Geocaches. The park itself is almost like a break or buffer between the Christchurch CBD and the suburb of Riccarton. There are many large trees throughout the park and many beautiful gardens. There is even a relatively shallow waterway that it is possible to kayak through as well. Hagley Park also incorporates the Christchurch Botanical Gardens. Throughout there are many beautiful gardens full of flowers at the time that I visited. The Groynes is a rather large park with many walking trails and a range of dog off leash areas. There are also some beautiful areas through the park such as this one with a tributary of the Waimakariri River running past. Cathedral Square sits at the centre of Christchurch when you look at Christchurch on the map. Depending on the map the city name will be almost on top. It is also the place where the Christchurch Cathedral, which was badly damaged in the 2011 earthquake stands still very much damaged. As you look at the buildings around the square, it can be rather difficult to see why some are barricaded off. While others show the very visible signs of the damage from the earthquake. Such as the building below which is fenced off but has no external signs of damage. I did not spend a lot of time in the Christchurch Central Business District. But on the one chance, I had to walk around there was a couple of interesting features that I spotted. The first was at one point when I came across this waterwheel. It does seem to be a relic of the past, but I wonder for what it might have been used. There is also the Bridge of Remembrance; I am not certain if the repairs were for the bridge itself or the archway. However, it is dedicated to those who died in World War I and serves as a memory to those who participated in both world wars. One interesting area of Christchurch that is new since the earthquake is the Renew Shopping Mall. It is in this area that a lot of shipping containers have been used to rapidly build a place for the shops to operate. It is an interesting area, and I wish I had been a coffee drinker at the time I visited as this might have been a good spot for coffee. There is a temporary art installation which in some ways acts as a memorial to the lives lost in the 2011 Earthquake. There sits here 185 empty white chairs each one representing a life lost in the earthquake. While I was out looking for Geocaches around Christchurch, there were some amazing spots that I discovered. This particular spot is near to a location known as Sign of the Kiwi and looks down across the hills to Governors Bay. The Waimakariri River runs a little to the north of Christchurch. The river flows for around 150km from the Southern Alps, across the Canterbury Plains to the Pacific Ocean. At this location, it is quite wide almost at the Pacific Ocean, but further upstream it flows in a braided fashion. The city of Christchurch and the surrounding area offers so much to see and explore. What I have shared today in this post is just a fraction of what I got to see myself and a smaller fraction of what is there to explore. I just did not always have the camera out at the right times to capture everything in pictures. I know that I will return to the area one day and delve in a little deeper, especially on some of the walks and hikes.

Mat and Brittany are both from the east coast, but ended up meeting after they had both moved to Colorado! They met online and corresponded for a while via email, then phone, and eventually met in person. By the time they met and went on a first date, they felt like they had already known each other forever.

The Columbus Dispatch Publishes Article on HB 413 | Public Employee Retirees Inc. (February 19, 2018) A revealing article on the status of H.B. 413 was published in the Sunday edition of The Columbus Dispatch yesterday shedding light on where the bill stands in the legislative process. It was authored by Dispatch reporter Catherine Candisky and can be read by copying and pasting this link in your web browser: http://www.dispatch.com/news/20180217/opers-retirees-fight-back-against-proposed-cut-in-benefits. It appears that in its present form the bill is not going to move toward passage in the Ohio House, according to its sponsor, Rep. Gary Scherer (R – Circleville). This is good news for PERI members and all OPERS retirees. PERI resolves to keep up the fight against the passage of HB 413 until OPERS and the General Assembly recognize the need to maintain the current 3% COLA. Thanks PERI, finally a ray of hope . Food for thought for all retirees, Keep contacting members of the general assembly to vote down h.b.413! Keep the heat on! What is meant by, “It appears that in its present form the bill is not going to move toward passage in the Ohio House”? It sounds like good news at first, but the issue is not over. I’m very happy by this delay, but we still need to work to have it dropped altogether. Something seems very wrong here. With all the sweeping changes OPERS made since 2012, including dropping spouses and jacking up premiums, why aren’t they putting money into the health care plan? If the current administration can’t seem to manage our money, maybe it’s time to find others who will. This doesn’t add up and an independent investigation seems to be in order. I would like to share some info. with all retirees. i retired from O.D.O.T. in 2012. When i worked for O.D.O.T. I was active in o.c.s.e.a. for a time. O.c.s.e.a. is the union for state employees in most agencies. When opers introduced their c.o.l.a. reduction fiasco last august, I contacted Chris Mabe who is o.c.s.e.a. president and opers board member for state employees. As per the conversation, The reasons he gave me for the proposal were as follows. The alleged 2 billion dollars in unfunded liabilities as per Karen Carraher. Mabe also gave me a personal reason for the proposal. Mabe told me he thinks it is not fair that people who retired prior to Jan. 2013 keep their 3% C.O.L.A. And people who retired after Jan. 2013 get their c.o.l.a. adjusted as agreed upon in the 2012 opers changes. So with this info. you have an opers board member who also had personal reasons for pushing this proposal. I spoke to Chris Mabe over the phone in late august of 2017. He returned the phone call after I left him a message on his voicemail. I also emailed him at that time. Well what everyone has to remember is if your already retired you have no way to increase your percent of retirement other than the COLA. If your not already retired you have the option to work longer and increase your retirement. “ Go figure “ Compell people who can retire before 2013 by sending out papers that say anyone who retires prior to 2013 will recieve 3 % COLA fixed ,then switch it with H.B. 413 COLA based off cpi after. People already retired don’t have an equal right to work longer and boost there percentage and increase there F.A.S. I believe PERI was able to exspress that concern during there presentation in Opposition of H.B 413. Ron Alexander is a candidate for OPERS Trustee to represent the retirees. He is also the retiree representative on the OCSEA Board with Mabe. I have emailed Ron Alexander requesting his position on this issue. We certainly don’t need two OSCEA officials on the OPERS Board voting together to cut our COLA. Right. We do not need a fox in the hen house. More food for thought. Late last December, The Opers board voted to make Chris Mabe Vice Chair! So I just read the Dispatch article and here’s what bothers me. It is clear that Karen Carraher is trying to play on the fear that If we don’t make these changes now we risk healthcare in the future. What I urge everyone to consider is that regardless of whether they make changes or not we could still lose or have changes made to our healthcare in the future. Healthcare is not a guaranteed benefit. I for one will not stand for changes being made to a guaranteed benefit, which my 3% annual COLA is, to take the chance that they won’t turn around at some point in the future and reduce or eliminate healthcare anyway. I won’t fall for their scare tactics. Retiree – I totally agree. I will not stand for changes to a guaranteed benefit either. If they take that away, then everything is fair game. The article in the Columbus Dispatch was an interesting read. Keep up the good work, PERI! Although this is encouraging we can’t let up. I have written to my State Representative and Senator and have received a response only from my Representative that he is opposed to HB 413. So far my state Senator seems to be non-committed. Remember the old adage “the squeeky wheel gets the grease”. Jerry – That is very interesting. I have long suspected a severe case of COLA envy has been going around at OPERS. And yes, I believe those pushing the proposal have a personal agenda. Otherwise, nothing else makes sense. The system is healthy and with the sweeping changes made including dropping spouses and jacking up our health care premiums, there should be no reason for fear of losing health care funding. As the old adage goes, when something doesn’t make sense, look for the dollars. Where did you obtain information on the 3 candidates and their positions? Thanks James for your insight. I agree after reading the Retiree Representative Candidate Biographies page included with my ballot, it becomes clear that Timothy Steitz is the correct choice if you want to protect your 3% COLA. His job experience and credentials make him the most qualified candidate to oppose Carraher’s dirty mess now and in the future. It’s important for anyone who hasn’t voted yet to do it now before the March 30th deadline and keep contacting our state legislative officials. Every day I e-mail, tweet, call or write. I point out the 50 people at OPERS making more than the governor, the billions invested in poor performing hedge funds, the most of any State and paying the managers of those hedge funds billions since 2011 and also paying their own chief financial officer over 1/2 million a year and millions more in incentives. Incentives for what, to invest in poor performing hedge funds or does he get incentives for cutting our COLA. Kasich was with Lehman Brothers and went around Ohio talking the public pensions into investing in Lehman Brothers. Lehman went out of business and the pensions lost multi millions. He becomes governor in 2011 along with Carrahar and we start investing in hedge funds. Funny hedge funds donated to his run for President in 2016. This cozy relationship the OPERS seems to have with some of the medical providers needs to be looked at. Double Dipping needs to be looked at, California does not allow it at all, go back to a public employee and your pension stops. I don’t know if we need to go that far, but the amount they pay in for pension goes into an annuity. That money should stay in the pension system, they are already collecting a pension and working for a public employee. QEBA needs stopped, violating IRS rules stating that they don’t have to pay pension out over around 215,000 per year. QEBA makes that extra money come out of the medical fund. I could go on for pages, however, that is some thing needing fixed. Keep writing as the State and every organization in it hates the sun light shine down upon them. When I worked I was told to work on clients that bitched first. Why should they get serviced first? The answer, we don’t want to have them calling every day and bothering us. Is that fair, no, but the squeaking wheel gets fixed first. Michael – Could you share copies of your letters? I don’t know the facts like you do. I would like to send that information to my representatives too. First, the “3% COLA” quit being a 3% increase in retirement benefits one year after retirement. It is a simple interest increase on the base retirement amount. It is NOT a true cost of living increase. Rather it is: 3%, 2.91%, 2.83%, 2.75%, 2.68%, 2.61%, 2.54%, etc. Next year I will get a 2.4% increase. We retirees who retired prior to 2013 are both diminishing in both numbers and our effective COLA increases. The only reason that I can see for the OPERS board to act now is because it will become a moot point in a the future. They want to treat retirees as welfare recipients. Why else would HB 413 contain a provision to INCREASE the retirement for a select few retirees? Second, as determined in the case of John J. MASCIO v. PUBLIC EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT SYSTEM OF OHIO, the vested rights statute (ORC 145.561), once the conditions of retirement are fulfilled, there is a contractual obligation. The Ohio Legislature (OPERS) does NOT have a legal right to alter a contract after the fact. Third, why the heck would any rational person (retiree) wish to trade a statutory guaranteed contractual right (pension + COLA) for the “promise” of health care? Back when I was working, 35 years, a percentage of my contribution was going for the health care of retirees. Now that I am retired, the OPERS board has cut health care to the bone and is out to get retirees who may have gotten a few percent ahead of inflation. Finally, I’m not trying to be political but the Federal deficit spending is such that the ten year Treasury rate is approaching 3%. Depending on the financial projection, 3% or 3.5%, is the break point at which money flows from the stock market to bonds and inflation becomes inevitable. Either way, a one trillion dollar Federal deficit will lead to higher inflation. That higher inflation will inflate OPERS investments, but will not change our COLA. Dean you just made a fantastic point, Retirees do not need Ron Alexander on the Opers board to represent retirees. Ron Alexander will be a yes person for Karen Carraher. Chris Mabe has proved he is a yes person for Karen Carraher! Retirees please consider not giving Ron Alexander a vote! I hope Alexander has an opponent for this board seat! If Ron Alexander has an opponent, Please consider that person! Ron Alexander is still on the O.C.S.E.A. payroll as an retirees Rep. He has taken enough dues money as o.c.s.e.a. president and now in this role as a retirees rep! I was an o.c.s.e.a. activist for a time. The internal politics at o.c.s.e.a. is sickening! Just food for thought. Thanks. I witnessed Ron Alexander manipulate the members and staff at o.c.s.e.a. for years! Please consider not voting for him for this open opers board seat! Please consider the opponents of Ron Alexander for this opers board seat! To vote Ron Alexander on the opers board would be a huge mistake. Remember, Chris Mabe will be lobbying on his behalf. And in private, I am sure Karen Carraher will be doing the same. She will be very quiet in doing so. I’ll keep writing and making phone calls until there is a full administration restructuring at OPERS. Jim – Who are you contacting? I will do likewise. Attention all retirees, I have taken a careful look at all the candidates for the open Opers board seat. I will vote for Tim Steitz, He seems to be the candidate that will stand up for retirees. Just food for thought. Vote carefully. If you worked when Ron Alexander was head of the union… you know he was very friendly to the statehouse. Personally I believe that the State of Ohio employees did benefit from collective bargaining I am just saying that was not while Ron Alexander was running things he was very close fo to management we do not need his self serving agenda in our retirement. Most people do not realize that public sector is not always the easy jobs they think. Too many managers politically connected (and union presidents) willing to do whatever necessary for their own personal advancement . But I thought once retired we would be away from the politics and the deals made in back rooms. Karen Carraher does not have enough respect for retirees to keep her as OPERS Ex Director. She wants to say that she has OPERS funded 100% and will do so at any cost. Keep fighting calling writing and unfortunately not relaxing and enjoying our earned retirements. Ohio politics once again rears its ugly head. We are fortunate that some in the statehouse see OPERS bill for what it is…. an unnecessary broken promise to retirees. Don’t stop being vocal, writing and calling state reps and telling them OPERS needs to keep their gritty hands off of our COLA. I noted it in my retirement letter as well. Actually I stated that it was “the” reason for the timing. Amen Frank! It is time retirees post their concerns about Ron Alexander on social media. All retirees should know about the troublesome background of Mr. Alexander! Also, It is time retirees start calling for Karen Carraher to be replaced! Start sounding the alarm on social media! Chris Mabe is just as bad as Ron Alexander if not worse! I’m with those who will vote for Tim Seitz as my candidate of choice. Thanks to those you who shared your views on all three candidates. Your comments were really helpful. The comments helped me vote for Mr. Seitz too. This kind of input is always great. I voted for Mr. Seitz also.

Nothing like the last day of the month to do my monthly update, right? February was a very hectic month, so unfortunately most of my reading was postponed until the end of the month. * Bridge to Terabithia by Katherine Paterson (reread) – This was my second reading of this particular book. The first time I read it was actually in college for a Children’s Lit class. I remember loving it the first time and the second time was no different. Bridge to Terabithia centers around the friendship between its two main characters – Jess Aarons and Leslie Burke. The two are unlikely friends, but their mutual awkwardness and shared tendency to behave “differently” from the status quo is enough to create a lasting bond. Together, they create their own magical land, the namesake Terabithia, where they go to escape their ordinary, if not depressing, lives. The story takes a turn when tragedy strikes Terabithia and Jess is forced to deal with things far beyond his ten or eleven years. At that point, it’s probably best to just go ahead and grab your tissues. My Take: Finding Bridge to Terabithia on “the list” was no surprise. This is one of those books that makes you reevaluate life and love. I appreciate that this book, written for very young adults (preteens even), touches on some very heavy topics in a way that is super-relatable. Being a teacher of young children allows me to read these kinds of books through a completely different lens. I see the Jesses and Leslies of the world every day in my own classroom – the kids that don’t quite “fit in” because maybe their family is a little bit different or they interested in something considered unusual for their age, gender, whatever. I’ve seen the way their lives change when they find that one friend with a common soul who understands and accepts them as they are. I want that for every child. It also makes me sad to think about how many kids out there are like this, but never find that one friend who will change their life… Overall, this book is an easy read with a big message and definitely worth the minimal time it takes to read. I dare anyone to try to get through the whole thing with dry eyes! Frindle is story about young Nick Allen who has a knack for causing minor “disturbances” at his elementary school – things like transforming his third grade classroom into a tropical paradise… and getting his first-year teacher to buy into it! However, after meeting his all-business fifth grade teacher (Mrs. Granger), Nick’s escapades seem to be in jeopardy. That is, until he spontaneously decides to create a brand-new word: frindle (to name the object formerly known as a pen). His seemingly harmless prank catches some steam and soon the word has grown beyond Nick’s control. Meanwhile, Mrs. Granger is doing everything in her power to thwart frindle-users everywhere. My Take: First of all, I love lovelove the character of Nick! I love the way his mind works and that his portrayal does not stay true to any one stereotype. He’s smart, but not nerdy. He’s unusual, but not a “weirdo.” He’s a bit mischievous, but not mean-spirited. Secondly, I love that this book, written for elementary- and middle-schoolers, isn’t focused on the social issues they may face at school, but rather on a child’s growing curiosity and innovation. So many books directed at this audience tend to deal with those social issues (admittedly important in more than one way), but I feel like we have a generation of children who need to know that creativity is important too. I feel like they need permission to take risks and to think outside the box, and more importantly, to want to have an impact beyond their immediate scope. Frindle at first glance is a funny story about a silly, made-up word, but the implications of what Nick created reach towards a greater purpose and hint at what can happen when kids make up their mind to change even one small part of their world! This book left me smiling and inspired to think big… Another easy, but worthwhile, read! So… what do you think? Has anyone else read Terabithia or Frindle? Do you agree with my reviews? I’m excited to hear everyone’s thoughts! Since meeting Tiffany almost three and half years ago, she and I have bonded over many things – our students, our shared teaching beliefs, our love of chocolate and other delicious food stuffs, our mutual devotion to television… We share “new finds” with each other all the time. I tried to give her a heart attack by making her watch 24 and she got me hooked on Revenge, Scandal, Gilmore Girls, and more. We also have a shared obsession with great young adult novels. For her birthday last year, I got her the Divergent box set and she introduced me to the Matched series. We read and talked, saw the movies and felt like we had a pretty good grasp on the world of young adult novels… until we found the list! In Tiffany’s post, she mentioned that she was disappointed that she had only read about a third of the list. I was more shocked than disappointed. I thought for sure that I would have read more of them! I felt very confident in my supreme knowledge of the genre. Alas, I too had only read about one third of the books! So, here is my list – divided into new books and rereads! Any surprises? 6. Are You There, God? It’s Me, Margaret. As promised, here is my version of the list, divided into “new reads” and “rereads.” To be honest, I was pretty disappointed that I had only read about a third of the entire list! Is it weird that I’m actually more excited about getting to reread some old favorites than something new? If you’ve read anything I haven’t, leave a note in the comments section so I will look forward to some of the others! Welcome to the Young Adult Book Challenge! Long story short, my friend Ashley and I are always looking for new things to read, particularly young adult novels. We had originally toyed with the idea of a 2015 new YA challenge list that was put out by Buzzfeed… then I came across this list of The 100 Best Young Adult Books of All Time put out by Time.com. I knew this was the challenge we should pursue. Of course, we had to start a blog about it! The list will be divided into New Reads and Rereads for each of us. At least one book from each list must be read each month. If a series is listed, only the first book must be read– any remaining books to be read are up to the reader. Blog posts must be written at least once a month to update our status and to review the books read. We are really excited to start the challenge and blog. Stay tuned for our lists and first reviews!

Dave Pelz believes that more golfers need to master their wedges if they are going to improve their scoring, especially the ones whose egos will not let them move up a tee and therefore never get to the greens in regulation. The Titleist Vokey Design SM4 features more aggressive individual grooves, 17 now instead of 14. There are 21 loft options from 46 to 64 and five sole grinds in three finishes—tour chrome, black nickel and oil can. While emphasizing a dynamic new theory about scoring clubs, SCOR Golf offers seven bac kweighing designs staggered thru the 21 degrees of options (41-61). The soles feature a higher bounce angle near the leading edge and lower bounce on the rest of the sole. The Cleveland S88 Forged is a remake of the cast version with milled microgrooves and a shaft with a less active tip for more penetrating ball flight. There are 19 loft/bounce option in chrome and satin. The Ping Anser features a reinforced back cavity that thickens the face to minimize fluctuation and enhance control and tungsten in the toe to keep CG in its proper position. It’s available with satin nickel chrome finish in six loft/bounce options from 60 to 60 degrees. The Nike VR Pro Forged features a higher concentration of deeper grooves and a cross-hatch pattern the grooves to improve surface roughness. Three new lofts among 10 options from 48 to 62 degrees feature a dual sole design intended to keep the leading edge closer to the ground even with an open face. It is available in three finishes—platinum, chorme and oxide. The Callaway Forged has21 tightly spaced grooves with sharper edge radii thanks to going to forging. It has straighter leading edge and a more gradual C-shape sole grind. Six loft/bounce options from 52 to 64 degrees and copper and trivalent dark chriome finishes offered. The Mizuno MP-R12 featurea more rounded head and grooves that are narrower on the lower lofts for full shot spin and grooves that are wider on the higher lofts for partial shot spin. It is available in nine loft/bounce options with white stain and black nickel finishes. The Bridgestone J40 features a milled face for increased surface roughness to produce more spin. A recessed section near the grip of the shaft is intended to produce a sharper angle of attack. It is available in five loft/bounce options from 62 to 60 degrees in satin chrome or black oxide finishes. The Cobra Trusty Rusty offers a retro look in its unplated, easier to rust, model and features a higher bounce angle in the center of the sole and relief areas in the heel and toe to keep the leading edge lower. Seven loft/bounce p[tions from 49 to 61 offered with two other finishes, black PVD and satin. The TaylorMade ATV has a wider sole with a center channel designed to allow the leading edge to stay closer to the ground. The face has sharper edged grooves and uniform microtexture between them to maximize spin. It’s available only in satin finish with seven loft/bounce options from 50 to 64 degrees.

He was proud to have honorably serve his country in the United States National Guard.
North Americans are known for living some of the busiest lives in the world. Few other people (if any) have as many competing demands on their time than we do. A few years ago I became aware of how obsessed everyone was with being busy. “How are things?” I would inquire. “Oh, you know, super busy.” came the reply. The way they would say it was one part complaint, three parts badge of honour. It was as though they wanted to signal that they too, were “busy.” Very, very busy. After going through a very stressful time in my life, I began a journey to live a radically less stressful existence. This meant many things, including stopping the instinct to be busy. I was shocked at how hard my brain tried to keep pushing me back to my old ways. The ways of my culture. Breathless, constant busyness was portrayed at almost every turn. Whether it is the corporate ladder climbing heroine in a movie, the businessman in a magazine ad or whatever, we have absorbed a view of success that demands 24/7 scheduling of our time. If we have a unifying religion in the West, it is Busyness. Interestingly, our brains and bodies seem to be suffering. Stress-initiated illnesses such as Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Anxiety/Depressive Disorders and Chronic Fatigue are sky rocketing. We are officially pushing ourselves beyond what we were designed to endure. Some times in our lives are unavoidably busy. As the owner and operator of a busy clinic, a serving member of my church and married father of FOUR kids under 14 I am a busy man. We also do quite a bit of traveling throughout the year. How did I pull this off? Allow me to explain. Research has shown that being active is healthy, but being negatively stressed is not. A few years ago, TED speaker and researcher Kelly McGonigal unveiled new research showing how our interpretation of our busyness can make the stress good or bad. Her evidence essentially showed that if we are overloaded by things we despise or dread, our bodies suffer. But exhaustion coming from activities we enjoy have seemingly positive effects on us. 1. Know Your Have-To’s and Make Them Fun: All of us have to do certain things. Work, cook, commute, etc. If you are lucky enough to do what you love, this won’t be hard. If you work a less than ideal job, well, make it fun. If prisoners in Auschwitz were able to find the good in their lives, you can to. This may take some time, but figure it out. No excuses. Your commutes can be times to plug into a podcast or other enjoyable audio experiences. Be hands-free on the phone with a loved one while cleaning/cooking. 2. Know Your Strengths and Grow Them: All of us have a unique contribution to make to this world and our generation. All of us. As a Christian, I believe very strongly that we bring something to the table of humanity that no one else in history could. If you are not engaged regularly in your passion, you will suffer. Just Do It. 3. Balance Your “3 Passions”: I recently discovered a wonderful piece of advice: “Have 3 passions in your life. One that makes you money. One that keeps you healthy. One that let’s you be creative.” Find those and work them into your life. Take up jiu jitsu or biking. Get into it. Do it. Start drawing. Playing the piano. Blogging. Expand your mind and influence. 4. Embrace Doing Nothing: If you wake up on a Saturday and immediately feel the urge to “do something,” you are caught in the Cult of Busyness. Your body and brain are accustomed to always trying to do something. Make money, clean the house, prepare for some future disaster, etc. The survival instinct is in overdrive in most North American minds. Interestingly, it has been proven that being overly busy destroys productivity. For me, the Art of Nothing comes in 2 forms. ONE, several times a day, even in busy clinic times, I take a 3 to 5 minute break. Either I close the curtain on a treatment table and nap or I watch a funny video on youtube. Just a smidgeon of “nothingness” to alleviate my body and soul. Just living, breathing, existing, being. TWO, for at least a full day each week, I do “nothing.” I can’t necessarily lay there all day because I have 4 children and a wife. But, I don’t do anything on impulse of “I have to.” I will lay in bed as long as I can before I get up. I only do the bare minimum of “have to’s.” I will chose the activities that I want to do, none that I don’t. I will not push the kids to be “doing something.” I will fight my brain’s push to get me to “BE PRODUCTIVE.” No. I don’t want to produce. I want to just exist. Medical marijuana is a hot topic nowadays. Justin Trudeau’s Liberal party is playing peekaboo with the possibility of legalizing marijuana and certainly helping grow the number of “medical” marijuana dispensaries throughout the country. One look at social media and google and you get thousands of messages about the miracle healing capacity of Cannabis Sativa. It appears there is nothing a little pot won’t cure. Claims range from pain relief to cancer prevention. Remarkable! My question is, are these claims true? Or are they a good dose of wishful thinking to help make the bitter pill of legalizing drugs taste better? First, you have to realize that less than 7% of all studies done on marijuana are researching its medicinal purposes. This is probably due to the fact that most marijuana research is funded by government agencies and these tend to relate to drugs in a negative sense. Government has a vested interest in understanding the negative effects of drugs in order to treat addicts and form drug use prevention methods. Pro marijuana advocates will say that the big pharmaceutical companies and the government are both invested in the continued ban of legal marijuana and so will continue to only look in the negative direction and downplay positive research. In part, I would agree that a large amount of research done by medical schools and even universities are funded by drug companies. And these companies have much less interest in finding natural cures than they do in validating synthetic drugs as the core of health care. Furthermore, there are a growing number of areas in which our culture is becoming aware of the plethora of natural cures available that Big Pharma drugs are not able to out-perform. Natural alternatives to anxiety, depression, blood pressure issues, pain management, etc are emerging as we better understand nutrition, exercise and cognitive behavioural therapy as well as other natural remedies. And if you delve into the realm of anecdotal evidence (both in your circle of friends and online) you will run into some convincing cases in which a marijuana compound was found more effective than a pharmaceutical alternative. I have not problems with the notion of finding natural alternatives to health issues, even in the Cannabis Sativa plant. But how confident can we be that marijuana has very strong medical benefits? And are there any side effects worth knowing about? For thousands of years mankind has used both Cannabis Sativa and the poppy seed for its felt effects. In regards to poppy seeds, they have long been known to help induce sleep. Likewise, cannabis has been known for the intoxicating effects of its most famous cannibinoid compound: THC. For at least the past 5,000 years, humans have known how to extract opium from poppy seeds. And since 1804, we have known how to extract morphine from the poppy seed as well. To this day, morphine continues to be our most potent pain killer. And it is a completely natural extract. My point? Poppy seeds have a very specific medical use that works universally: pain killing. No one can doubt or disprove this. There is no need to hunt through conflicting anecdotal and peer reviewed accounts to see what (if any) are the medically useful aspects of poppy seeds. In contrast, even though we have been experimenting with cannabis for as long as we have been with poppy seeds, we know of only two universal effects that come from marijuana: intoxication and appetite stimulation. Since at least the 1980’s, hospitals have been giving synthetic THC to cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy because of its remarkable ability to stimulate appetite even in extreme circumstances. But the effectiveness of marijuana for the entire host of claims made online remain tenable and less than solidly proven. There are hundreds of cannabinoid compounds in marijuana, THC is only one of them (and the only real psychoactive one). Cannabidiol is another of these and it has little to no intoxicating effects, making it less controversial. Cannabidiol has been touted mainly as an anti-psychotic and anti-convulsant. Yet its effects are nowhere near universally true (in contrast to morphine) or even very repeatable. Some studies have shown some value in cannabidiol for sleep inducement as well as pain killing and muscle relaxants for Multiple Sclerosis and epileptic patients. But the strength of the evidence is not overwhelming at this point. More time is needed because studies have gone in both directions. Cannabis simply does not have a singular, universal medical value that can be proved conclusively. As for THC, it does indeed decrease fluid pressure inside the eyes and so will relieve glaucoma symptoms. But the effects only last a short while and because THC is psychoactive, intoxication co-exists with the effects, making it unlikely to be safe or helpful for people who have to go to work with their glaucoma medication. To be under the effects of THC all day is not a recommended lifestyle. Especially when safe, non-intoxicating and long lasting drugs do exist for glaucoma sufferers. THC also dilates the small airways in the lungs, bringing relief to those with asthma, COPD and other chronic lung conditions. Again, this effect is short lived and comes with intoxication and alternative exist in both the natural and pharmaceutical realms. All in all, the effects of marijuana on a variety of medical conditions is not cut and dry. Even when positive studies are found, they are not very strong and often you will find other studies that failed to replicate the findings. However, if an individual is finding success with a cannabinoid compound, I am not against its use. I support the right for doctors to oversee and prescribe a variety of cannabinoids (often with little to no THC) in the few cases in which better alternatives do not seem to exist. I don’t see, however, how wholesale legalization has to come hand in hand with the few cases in which genuine medical marijuana usage can be rationalized. It is also curious that it is mainly the psychoactive THC that gets most of the attention from medical marijuana activists. Could it be because it is marijuana’s main intoxicant? And that rationalizing its use would excuse chronic intoxication? Maybe. Just maybe. Before closing this brief article, I have to speak about the negative side effects of THC and marijuana.Since the 1980’s, the percentage – by weight – of marijuana that is THC has arisen in the United States from an average 3% to approximately 12%. This has not occurred naturally but is the result of synthetically manipulating the strains. Much the same way men have bred animals and plants over the centuries. Obviously, the main drive for increasing THC concentration is to maximize intoxication in chronic users who are now desensitized to former dosages. This phenomenon occurs with all artificial intoxicants. And the 12% figure is an average in the U.S., not worldwide. Some strains have been found to be as high as 35% THC by weight. A staggering dosage that is not in the least naturally occurring. With the rise of THC percentages in recreational marijuana we have seen a rise in the ill effects of this drug. The most susceptible — as is always the case — are youths. Studies in both the U.S.1 and Canada2 have shown — with functional MRI’s, blood work, psychological evaluations, brain mapping and sociological research — that a developing brain exposed to marijuana use well before the age of 17 is at risk of cognitive, mood and behavioural disorders. Further, the higher the usage, the lower the youth’s chances are of attaining financial health and independence in adult life. Chronic early use is needed to truly trigger serious disorders but the risks are still ominous. Considering the growing push to render marijuana use socially acceptable combined with the sharp rise in THC concentrations it should be no wonder that health care facilities are reporting more and more issues with adolescent and young adult marijuana use. Proponents of marijuana legalization will say that alcohol is also a drug and that it causes more carnage in our culture than marijuana. Both claims are true. However, alcohol use is much, much higher than marijuana use. Partly because it is legal and mostly because it is culturally acceptable. If marijuana use reached the same levels of use in North America the societal ills caused by this drug would not diminish, they would only grow exponentially. Unleashing another negative substance on our youth and culture is not an improvement by any means. I cannot comprehend this version of the pro-legalization argument. Remember that alcohol can be used in moderation. A glass or two of wine can even be beneficial in every way to your health with zero side effects. It is much harder to use marijuana without intoxication or side effects unless you strip it of its psychoactive compounds (which I do not see any medical marijuana dispensaries doing as this would most likely curb sales downward). And before singing the praises of local dispensaries, realize that a Journal of American Medical Association study, John Hopkins Medicine study as well as a Globe and Mail investigation found that the labels on pot products from such stores were grossly inaccurate. Shedding a poor light on the ability of such outlets to regulate the quality and safety of their drugs. Considering the negative side effects of THC and the shakily established “medicinal” value of Cannabis Sativa, pushing for nation-wide legalized marijuana on every street corner – a la neighbourhood liquor store — seems to be a thinly veiled attempt at plainly and simply legalizing an intoxicant for the pleasurable effects it produces. Arguments can be made as to the economic consequences of legalizing pot, yet this is a different argument than the medicinal one. Be wise. Be prudent. Be informed. The Olympics are over and the new school year is around the corner. I don’t know about you, but watching world class athletes run, jump and swim at peak performance inspires me. I love goal setting. Yet in the past, I set too many goals with too many deadlines. I started on a lot of journeys that did not end where they were supposed to. So I refined my goal setting methods. One thing I tossed out was the big deadline. This is that “etched into stone” date at which you want something completed. I see this as the biggest motivation killer. What happens if you get sick? Or injured? Or have a family or personal crisis? Have a goal in mind for your journey, but do not add a set date. Instead, make a weekly routine up that is broken down into daily tasks. Make them reasonable. For example, if your goal is to increase hip flexibility and the amount of weight you can squat, start small. MONDAY: squat with same weight you have been using but add 3 reps. Stretch for 12 minutes instead of 10. Then, every time you squat, add either 1 rep, or 2.5 lbs per side (5 overall). Usually do both, back and forth. If you hit the wall, don’t add anything for two or more weeks, just keep squatting without going backwards on your reps or weight. Slowly add 30 seconds here and there to your stretching. Off you go on a slow but risk-free and fully realistic journey towards constant improvement. People often over shoot their goal setting and force unrealistic changes onto their lives. Life does not work this way. Change has to be gradual but constant. So slowing down the demands actually increases the speed of results. If you are driving a car and you want to make a 90 degree turn, you cannot go immediately to a 90 degree without turning the wheels 1, 2, 3… 10… 25… 75 degrees and so on. Life is about increments, not instantaneous results. If you can introduce a slow, flexible, daily routine towards improved performance, you will successfully change your long term life style towards your goals. Whether they be financial, relational or health oriented. Dream big, act small. Get there! Over-training is a phenomenon that is becoming better understood. Many enthusiastic athletes forget to listen to their body as they pursue excellence. But this will serve to decrease performance in the long run, not improve it. Many fitness participants follow gruelling schedules and push themselves hard. If you are in the category of people who train regularly you will want to realize when over training begins to set in and you’ll also want to adopt a “smart rest” program as part of your training. If you have 4 or more of the above (especially the resting heart rate), you qualify as being over-trained. It’s high time to take some time off. A solid 3 weeks of no exercise followed by one or two weeks of very low intensity, part time exercise will do you much good. Then head into a 2 week period of moderate exercise and then finally, take another full week off. Be warned, if you are drastically over trained however, it could take several weeks — even a few months — to recuperate. Which is why you want to listen for the beginning signs of over training and not the drastic symptoms. If you are not over trained (have less than 4 — or none — of the above symptoms) you will want to incorporate “smart rest” techniques to ensure you never get over trained. Very simply put, smart rest is pro-active breaks in your training that allows your body to recuperate before you ever go near the over training zone. As we train hard, week in and week out, our multiple body systems can start to fall behind in recovery. This can be our nervous system, our psychological state, our immune system or our musculoskeletal system. Depending on what other stresses are going on in our lives and how well nourished we are, any one of those systems can start lagging behind and cause over training to set in. By pro-actively resting before anything falls far behind, we are protecting ourselves from over training. How Do I Implement Smart Rest? Once every 6 to 10 weeks (you decide by listening in on how your body and mind are feeling), take an entire week off training. During this time, you can go for walks, but no exercise. None. You will want to push the fluids more than usual during your week of rest and you will want to stay away from alcohol and high sugar foods. Nutrition, hydration and rest are the antidotes to over training. Make sure you are going to bed early and on time during this week of rest. Not only will smart rest prevent over training but it keeps your body and mind working at their peek. This will prevent mental burnout as well as injury. Remember, you are not to wait until you are starting to over train to implement smart rest, you are supposed to inject one full week of rest once every 6 to 10 weeks regardless of how well you feel. This is what maintenance looks like. You are building a fence at the top of the hill instead of having an ambulance at the bottom. Try it out and see for yourself the benefits of smart rest! Athletes pay big bucks to go into hyperbaric oxygen tanks and essentially give their bodies oxygen baths. With the increase in atmospheric pressure and a pure injection of oxygen, the body’s tissues (muscles, organs, nervous system) get a hyper-dose of O2 which increases the rate and depth of healing and repair. In fact, stroke victims are being placed through a series of hyperbaric oxygen tank treatments to create an increase in healing of the affected brain areas. As great as this is, many folks cannot afford regular hyperbaric treatments. Luckily, there is a natural alternative. Although not as intensive as hyperbaric treatments, this natural hyper-oxygenation method is risk-free and can be done anywhere, any time. It is simply the art of concentrated deep breathing. Essentially it consists of reaching a state of near hyper ventilation by repetitive deep breathing for a prolonged period of time. Studies have shown that deep breathing not only gives an increased dose of oxygen to the brain and body tissues, but it ignites the body’s “relaxation response.” This response is mediated by the parasympathetic nervous system and does the opposite of the stress response (controlled by our sympathetic system). Stress tends to constrict capillaries and shorten our breaths, resulting in hypo-ventilation. So it may be time to incorporate deep breathing to not only enrich your brain, but relax it as well. As you get comfortable deep breathing, you can adjust it to your liking. Some people like taking 5 or more seconds to inhale. There is no right or wrong, as long as you follow the basic guidelines above. Personally, I enjoy deep breathing outdoors as the air is much more fresh. Don’t be surprised if you feel the tips of your fingers or toes tingling once you’ve completed several breathes, this is one side effect to hyper oxygenation. If you are light headed or nauseous, you may want to pause momentarily. Regular deep breathing is beneficial for anyone. It helps counter stress. It helps athletes decrease recovery time. It is not as popular as regular exercise and good nutrition, but it is a highly recommended health habit. Reading can make your brain more fit. Researchers at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia used functional MRI’s to see how reading affects brains. They found that engaging in a good book will fire up not only the language centres of the brain but the sensory areas as well. And it will stay activated as an “afterburn” for up to a day or more afterwards. Sensory activation was an unexpected outcome and the conclusion was that the imagination mimics what the brain is reading. So if you’re reading a high action adventure, your brain “feels” what the character is doing and you are vicariously living through the book. Research conducted in 2009 at Mindlab International at the University of Sussex showed that reading relaxes the body and brain faster than listening to soothing music. Other research has pointed to reading as one of the key activities that can help stave off Alzheimer’s and senile dementia. A common phenomenon in our culture is to gather our information from audio/visual mediums. In an age of the internet and massive repositories of videos (e.g.: Youtube) people are reading less and less. Screen time is replacing study time. Unfortunately, passively gathering information from audio/visual sources does not work the brain as well. In fact, it places it in a state that is less active than sleep. It is essentially a brain-numbing activity. Furthermore, research is showing that screen time in bed works against good sleep. Staring into a light source actually tricks the body’s circadian rhythm into believing it’s time to wake up, so your brain is being woken up just when you should be winding it down. Reading at bedtime will expose your true fatigue and will put you to sleep at the appropriate time and will not disturb your sleep. Reading also is known to stimulate creativity and memory skills. Not to mention getting all the overall cognitive improvements that result when you regularly give your brain a workout. Whether you love fiction or non-fiction (or both) adding a good 15 to 30 minutes of reading into your day can have a powerful impact on your mental health. One of the hallmarks of childhood is how much darn fun we have. Unfortunately, many of us lose this capacity as we grow into adulthood. Although some things are childish and should not follow us into later life, some things kids do are pretty darn smart. Laughing a lot is one of them. You don’t need to laugh all day. Try taking time 4 or 5 times a day to see, read or think of something funny. This builds up and probably gives you 15 to 20 minutes of solid laughter each day. If stress has built up beyond a certain point, you may find it hard to relax and have fun. Fortunately, this can be worked at (like anything else). Make time in your day when you do things you enjoy (or used to enjoy). Regardless of whether or not you get a huge kick out of these, just practice doing something other than work and worry. Watch light hearted comedies. Mr. Bean episodes or Just For Laugh Gags are great starts. Stay away from the 24-hour News Cycle. It only reports on the most horrid atrocities and with the most stressful angle. News websites and channels are taping into your stress centers and getting you hooked on bad vibes. Take one or two months off the news. Seriously, try it! Read more and read light hearted books. Sometimes reading classic children’s literature is the best antidote to being too “grown up.” There is much wisdom in classic books. Work at thinking positively, hanging out with people more and maybe engage in activities that make you laugh (charades, goofy party games, etc). It’s never too late to rediscover the healthier things in life. Relationships, fun, laughter and good vibes. Our world is made up of both good and bad events. Whichever you focus on the most will predominate your life. If you are a human living on earth, chances are you have a social media account. Whether it be facebook, twitter, pinterest or any of the hundreds of options available, people are “connecting” through this digital medium. Therefore, with so much “connecting” going on we should all be very happy and loneliness should be on its way to extinction, right?.. The data has come in and it appears our social ills have only been increased due to compulsive internet use, including social media. An article from the CyberPsychology & Behaviour magazine by PhD psychologists Kim, LaRose and Peng showed that those turning to the internet to fill a social and emtional void were only further disconnected from true human relationship. For many of us who were born in the early 80’s or earlier, a world without social media is easy to imagine. A time when contact was real and organic. In contrast, modern concepts of human connectedness are — for the first time in human history — composed almost as much by digital “relationships” as they are by real human contact. Combine this trend with the affordable nature of mobile devices and the near omnipresence of Wi Fi connections and you can see how we have been transformed into homo sapien digitalis. When I go to the grocery store or to the bank, I hardly ever see anyone stuck in line that will turn and start conversing. They used to. Nowadays, most everyone is looking down at a mobile device if they are at a bus stop, in a line up or even at the park while their kids are playing. I’ve even seen a couple at a restaurant texting away and ignoring each other! After more than a decade of heavy social media use, it appears that we’ve come full circle and must realize that there is no replacing true human contact. The superficial nature of online relationships are millions of miles removed from the real touch of actual human social connection. Soul to soul. Not IP address to IP address. Third world countries who live with much less technology have lower rates of anxiety and depression. Although there are many reasons for this statistics, one thing is certain: they are forced to live more authentically then most Westerners because they deal with people all day, not avatars and internet trolls. The average third world resident’s day includes human contact that is comprised of actual human relationship and has nearly zero time spent in cyber-relationships. I’m not advocated the annihilation of social media, but a much more restricted use of it. A University of Waterloo self-administered test can be used to evaluate whether or not your are spending too much time “connecting” through your computer or mobile device. Although determining this will be more of an art than a science. Perhaps another way to gauge your social media usage is to ask yourself how many of your social media usage is for business or for pleasure. It is inevitable to be hooked into online business connections. It is the new phone book. But it may be unhealthy to use it too much for personal emotional voids. I’ve recently asked myself how many of my “friends” on social media would actually take time to help me physically if I had an urgent need such as moving or renovating my house hold. The list is probably MUCH smaller than the hundreds of names on my facebook friends’ list. Just food for thought. I work in an exercise rehabilitation clinic and prescribe hundreds of different types of exercises. Yet I am surprised at how few adults in our society continue to play their favourite sport once they hit their 30’s and beyond. Usually, once the demands of family and work set in, they turn to mechanical treadmill and dumbbell routines. Fitness has officially become a “must do” and not a “I wanna do!” This is highly unfortunate and in the long term promotes increasing sedentary lifestyles. One simple alternative is to play a sport as part of your fitness approach. There is far less routine in an individual or team sport than in a repetitive gym routine. Further, sports tend to use the body in a safer and more natural manner than many exercise machines and heavy weight workouts do. And they almost inevitably work the core muscles much more than most people’s weight lifting or cardio routine. Everyone who already plays a sport should add sport-specific exercises to improve their performance. That’s what the pros do. Yet most people who are not professional athletes usually do not see playing sports as a legitimate means of getting or staying fit. there are no “all out” avenues for them in their beloved sport. Thankfully, this is is false. With a 5 minute phone call to your local rec centre or YMCA, you will be shocked at how much friendly competition is available for the average joe. I feel that because competition is missing from many individuals’ fitness lifestyle so is the natural motivation to do better and better. If you are willing to compete at something, the psychological and physical rewards increase tremendously. And please don’t get me wrong. I know how life can get crazy busy. You don’t have to join a league that comes with fees and a tight practice schedule, etc, etc. But you can join rec leagues that allow you to jump in and compete any time you are free. My wife and I are raising and homeschooling 4 young children. I have my own practice and am involved at church. Yet 4 times per week my wife attends the YMCA and does a lot of TRX group classes. This group factor is an indirect but real form of competition. It is as much competition as she wants and so she thrives on it. It pushes her harder than solo workouts. I have fallen in love with Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. I train under Adam Zugec at ZUMA. Whenever I show up I have the opportunity of getting friendly competition. The competitive element keeps my mind focused, gets me off my worries and I workout harder than I otherwise would without even noticing it! Whether it is swimming, racquet ball, tennis, hockey or a running group, the social and physical benefits of a group or competitive environment is available for the non-professional athletes. I highly recommend it. A recent study by the Edinburgh University showed that people over 70 who walked during the week had less brain shrinkage then those who were sedentary. Researchers followed nearly 700 people for 3 years, performing before-and-after brain MRI’s to determine their findings. The study also claimed that reading books or doing crossword puzzles does not seem to help as much as regular, non-strenuous exercise. Seniors who walked during the week had less damage to the inner part of the brain (i.e.: the white matter) and they had more outer brain (i.e.: gray matter). So it appears you can increase your brain size with even a mild form of regular exercise. A Harvard Medical School article stated that a review of literature on depression examined evidence going back to 1981 and concluded that in younger and older patients with depression, regular walking was an effective treatment for emotional problems. It appears something even as simple as daily walks can significantly enhance mental and emotional well being. If you are simply starting out with an exercise program, walking 3 to 5 days per week is enough to see a boost in your brain’s health. As time goes on, a good idea is to diversify your activities. Joining a local recreation centre offers access to swimming, weight lifting and other fitness activities. This keeps you interested and it keeps your brain and body adapting to new acitivities. Which increases the degree to which your brain grows and benefits from an active lifestyle. So you see, it’s easy to make your brain healthy and stave off unwanted ailments! Get out there and enjoy a nice walk today.

As an American living in Japan, Pope dealt with immigration in his international travels and thought the experience, which he describes as “tense”, could be made into a fun game.

SecurShred destruction process ensures compliance with HIPAA disposal requirements. Congress recognized the need for national patient record privacy standards in 1996 when they enacted the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). The law included provisions designed to save money for health care businesses by encouraging electronic transactions, but it also required new safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of that information.

I feel so lucky. The man i am with is so amazing to me. My last relationship fucked me up so bad emotionally and mentally that i have trust issues, insecurities, I question things.. My ex chrated on me off n on for 2 yrs and was narcasistic and manipulative. He secluded me to make me feel like i couldnt rely on anyone but him. And my man now is helping me through all of these issues. I never feel like i have to beg him for attention and to love me. I dont feel so alone all the time. Yesterday I had a bad moment and he told me im not gonna scare him away. And I didnt realize how much tension I had had all day until he said that. Ladies, I am strong. Everyone has moments or days where they arent though and you just need someone to be there for you. I am so lucky that i have him. Im currently in washington for a wedding and he's in phx but every morning he messages me good morning and that he misses me and hopes i have a good day because he works all day long and cant get to his phone most of the time and is exhausted once he gets home so he usually falls asleep immediately. But he takes the time in the morning to show me he cares about me. And it honeestly means so much to me.

Whistleblowers often have a tough time taking on their employer. Even those that take on a former employer can still face an uphill battle. It is often a true David versus Goliath fight, one in which a single employee tries to take on huge and powerful corporations. To encourage whistleblowers to file suits and help stop greed and fraud, the law allows whistleblowers to receive a cash award of up to 30% of what the government collects. Million dollar awards are common. In addition to the awards, the law also protects whistleblowers from retaliation. The court can award double damages to an aggrieved employee. Finally, the False Claims Act provides that the whistleblowers’ legal counsel can be awarded fees and costs. This is especially important when the lawyers must prosecute the case privately or spend years prosecuting retaliation claims. Recently the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals decided a case involving these counsel fees. For those not familiar, the 6th Circuit is the top federal appeals court covering Ohio, Kentucky, Michigan and Tennessee. Those of us who primarily represent whistleblowers don’t always consider it the friendliest court but an opinion this month certainly shows that the court still appreciates whistleblowers and the need for counsel fees. In 2014, Community Health Systems (CHS) agreed to pay $97 million to settle claims that the company engaged in medically unnecessary emergency admissions, illegally paid kickbacks to physicians who referred patients to the company’s Laredo Medical Center and improperly billed for inpatient procedures. The case was actually the consolidation of several cases filed by whistleblowers. Because all the alleged wrongdoing involved Medicare, the cases were brought under the federal False Claims Act. After the case settled, a dispute arose over the nearly 7,000 hours of billable time expended by the several law firms that were involved in the case. “I write separately to address the purposes and goals of the False Claims Act, which set the perspective through which the courts (and the government) should view all FCA litigation. “Health care fraud is rampant in the United States. Some estimate that fraud costs Medicare and Medicaid between $30 billion and $98 billion annually. In one way or another, we all pay for this fraud through higher health insurance premiums, copayments, and taxes. “The FCA is one of the Government’s most effective tools for combatting health care fraud. ‘To date, the FCA has helped the government recover more fraudulently spent Medicare dollars than any other mechanism within the federal government.’ (Joshua A. Levy, Lessons from the Private Enforcement of Health Care Fraud). In 2014, for instance, while the Government recovered only $454 million through the Department of Health and Human Services’ fraud prevention system, it recovered $2.3 billion from health care FCA cases. In addition, evidence provided by FCA whistleblowers has resulted in dozens of criminal convictions and administrative exclusions that otherwise may not have occurred. “Without a doubt, relators and their attorneys play a vital role in rooting out health care fraud and obtaining recovery of the public monies that were intended to be spent for providing health care to veterans and poor, elderly, and disabled citizens. Fostering such recoveries under the FCA must include recognition that theseactions are not without economic risks and other dangers to relators and their counsel. A relator takes very real risks in coming forward to report fraud—an action that often includes obtaining and providing evidence against his/her employer that involves substantial sums of money and potential criminal liability. And providing that evidence is just the beginning. Attorneys then must undertake the substantial investigative work and expense of putting together a case for their relators then present it to government officials to determine if the government is willing to proceed with the litigation. Counsel routinely undertake this work without knowing whether other qui tam complaints have been filed under seal elsewhere. If the government decides that the information provided would be useful to it in vindicating society’s interests, it may share information about other qui tam cases and create a group of counsel to do the work that is necessary to prosecute the case. This work often takes years during which the government runs the sealed case, including assigning tasks to various counsel and approaching the defendant about the claims and monetary settlement. To consummate any settlement it negotiates, the government intervenes in and unseals the qui tam complaints filed by relators on its behalf. Though the government’s bargain sets the basic terms of the settlement agreement, the timetable, and resolves payment to the relators; counsel are often left to negotiate the terms governing payment of attorney fees—even for the considerable work accomplished by counsel at the government’s behest. Much is at stake because these negotiations may determine whether a defendant—which took public money through health care fraud—must pay a relator’s counsel for their work in forcing the return of that money. There are practical reasons for this framework but it also entails practical problems: negotiations are often rushed, counsel for the various relators may have differing opportunity to draft agreement terms, and they do not have the leverage that the government has. The case is United States ex rel. Doghramji, (6th Cir. Nov. 22, 2016). It is refreshing to see that courts truly appreciate the value that whistleblowers and their lawyers contribute to society and particularly the hardships that whistleblowers must endure when taking on a powerful company. We are honored to represent whistleblowers and frequently humbled by the sacrifices they make to put a stop to greed, fraud and corruption. If you have inside information about such wrongdoing, you too may be entitled to an award. To determine whether you may have a claim, give us a call. All inquiries are confidential and without obligation. Even if you never hire us, what you tell us is protected by the attorney – client privilege. Our experienced whistleblower lawyers’ can help evaluate your case, investigate and file your claim and protect you against illegal whistleblower retaliation claims. In the last five years, we have helped our clients collect over $100 million in awards.
Since 2010, Microsoft has been working on a gaming display system so small that it wouldn't need to be sitting on an entertainment unit or even held in your hands. You could wear it in a pair of glasses. Or in a stupid helmet. The company sees two avenues for such technology: the glasses are an entertainment possibility, while the helmet, being the more heavyweight solution of the pair (including the same display tech but with an accompanying headpiece), could be used for gaming or more practical uses like aviation. How would the glasses work? It's proposed in a patent that to get around the problem of the human eye being unable to focus on objects so close, it would distort to appear as though it was 21 inches away. The glasses could also adjust their transparency depending on the use's tastes or a game's needs, so you could black everything out and just focus on the action, or conversely use the specs as augmented reality devices able to overlay imagery onto the real world. Sounds crazy at first, but then, the future always does. Remember, standard patent disclaimers apply: just because a company is researching stuff like this doesn't mean it'll ever come to market, etc etc. For Plunkett, this is a pretty impressive piece! This "use's tastes" do not include articles by this clown. This has good real world application the HUD in aircraft and other uses like driving get a gps/HUD for road speeds an signs etc. Am I the only one who thought of this? http://www.1up.com/features/untitled_25 I so wanted the Nintendo Revolution to be that, It reminded me of a case study I did with a mate back in Uni on AR.

I have created a database of prospects who have used services in the past similar to what we offer. I understand the traditional ways of prospecting but in search of ideas which can give us maximum traction. All leads are qualified and don’t want to lose out on any single. What kind of response can I expect from 5K contacts? Thank in advance. No one can give you a legitimate answer to this question. First, while you have pre-qualified your leads somewhat they are not qualified yet. You and I have no idea whether they still need services like what you offer, or are open to talking about another supplier if they are. Second, not all prospects are a fit on personality. You are not going to get along with everyone, and you do not want everyone as a customer. Not wanting "to lose out on any single" prospect is a dangerous and frankly impossible mindset. Again, some people will be "Clients From Hell" and you do not want them in your business. And as above, you are simply not going to get "everyone" as your customer. So every time you do not, you are going to view that as "failure", which is disempowering and incorrect. Third, the message of your offer and how well or poorly it matches up with that target market will determine who even talks to you. So there are many factors here outside the scope of this answer, such as who writes the copy, how good the pain points are and the level they resonate with the target market, the media/distribution channel you use to reach them, and so on. Now if I was in your shoes, I would qualify further and then test. So say out of these 5000 leads you qualify further for size and another pain point or two in your copy. Maybe you have a great call to action that separates the wheat from the chaff and gets engagement. You estimate--because that is all you can do at this point; you don't have any data to plan with, but as time goes on you'll collect some and be able to plan with increasing accuracy--30% will do the action...take a survey...sign up to watch a video...request a white paper. Now you're down to 1,667 better-qualified prospects. If you get 10% of these to buy, you'd be doing well and that's 167 sales. 1 > Does this level of funnel flow support your money needs? Is 167 X $sale price$ = enough revenue for the period? 2 > Is this a sufficient activity level? The most common thing people discover on a coaching call with me is that they do not have enough leads going into their funnel to generate the revenue they need out the other end. They're flying by the seat of their pants and hoping. Then you run the test and see what happens. Your feedback tells you how pre-qualified your traffic source really was, and how good or bad your conversion tool is. Compare Planned to Actual results, hone in on where you can get your greatest bang for your buck, and adjust. Let me share a secret with you: it's usually the Traffic source. You can work on Conversion until you're blue in the face, but if Traffic is poor quality, you're only going to develop a trickle of sales no matter what you do. But a moderate change in Traffic quality can have a huge impact on Conversion, no matter how poor your conversion tool may be. I've given you indicators to look at here and concepts to think about. But again, no one can tell you truthfully what kind of response you'll get from your list. You have to estimate, test, and adjust. The prospect list is created based on our internal strategy of generating qualified leads with 100% certainty that these people have bought similar services in the past. We know for a fact that these people may or may not be interested now or are working with some other service providers. We want to reach out to each and every prospects so as to maximise our chances of engagement and closure. The traditional method of cold call/mail is all fine but I am looking at new ways so as to create an interest among them.

A group of businesses and doctors from Fukushima prefecture are suing GE in US court over the negligence of their reactor design. The suit claims that GE’s reactor design used at Fukushima Daiichi was reckless and negligent and that GE knew the design could not withstand earthquakes and tsunamis. Deficiencies of the design have been known since the 1970’s. JAPCO, the quasi governmental company that runs the Tokai nuclear site in Japan and ran the Monju fast breeder reactor has admitted to spending most of their decommissioning fund. This fund, required of all nuclear reactor operators in Japan was intended to assure there was money available to eventually decommission their old nuclear plants. JAPCO admitted to spending most of this fund to build reactors 3 and 4 at the Tsuruga nuclear plant. This has left the company so cash strapped they can’t afford the required upgrades to potentially restart any of their remaining reactors. This is the same company holding the unique distinction of being the only power company in Japan to so grossly neglect safety at a nuclear plant that they will never be allowed to restart that plant. In another incident Japan’s nuclear regulator discovered that Japan Nuclear Fuels skipped safety checks at the Rokkasho nuclear fuel reprocessing plant for 14 years. Japan’s nuclear regulator said recently that reactor restarts are not expected to speed up any time soon. With most of the nuclear reactors in Japan still offline and no major change in the restart process, the future of Japan’s energy mix is now in question. Previous estimates continued to pin their hopes on a sudden restart for many of Japan’s nuclear reactors. With that being less likely it may require some significant changes to official policy. Two more reactors in Japan will now be permanently shut down. The unit 1 and 2 reactors at the Oi nuclear plant will permanently shut down. Rising costs to attempt to meet new safety standards put in place after the 2011 disaster were cited as the reason. TEPCO has begun installing defueling equipment on top of unit 3 at Fukushima Daiichi. The fuel handling machine and overhead crane were hoisted onto the refueling floor level in anticipation of installation of the final sections of the defueling building. View of workers and the Fukushima governor on the unit 3 refueling floor inside the defueling building. 1010 contaminated cars at the Fukushima Daiichi disaster site will be scrapped. The cars are a combination of work vehicles and personal vehicles of workers that were discovered to be heavily contaminated. Exactly how these vehicles will be scrapped and disposed of was not mentioned. Tohoku towns have decided they are not interested in Tokyo’s Olympics push. The national government initially hatched their plan for the Olympics as a PR move to try to wash away the Fukushima disaster. Part of this plan included efforts to place as many activities as possible related to the Olympics in Fukushima and nearby prefectures. So far only 11 of the 127 available towns have applied to participate. At least one cited the need to focus on rebuilding efforts. The central government has also established a second “rebuilding hub”. This one is to be located in Okuma, just outside the grounds of Fukushima Daiichi. The location is part of the “difficult to return zone” also known as the areas with the highest radioactive fallout from the disaster. Current work includes attempts to decontaminate the area and repair infrastructure. The government eventually plans to try to convince 1500 residents to return. Housing for 1000 workers from the Fukushima Daiichi disaster site is to be built in the area. Plans include an effort to resume farming rice and vegetables in this area. The EU will lift a number of food restrictions put in place after the Fukushima disaster. This includes rice, certain vegetable products and some seafood varieties. These foods would no longer have to prove they are not contaminated or not from the contaminated areas of Japan. Fukushima evacuees have brought their concerns to the UN Human Rights Council. They cite the efforts to force evacuees to return to contaminated home towns as a violation of their human rights. The family of a dialysis patient who died after delayed treatment due to the nuclear disaster has sued TEPCO. There have been other lawsuits due to death related to the nuclear disaster. This is the first specifically involving a dialysis patient.

you feel your life is slipping out of your control coz your weight is going out of control. your sweet tooth is driving you nuts and causing you weight gain every month. even after you ate a rich and sinful lunch, you still crave for an ice blended cholocate mocca? if you deny your body’s desire to snack, you are unable to concentrate on anything else- it will bug and bug you till you give in to it. tried lots of diet (including starvation) and in the end, put on more weight than ever? people always think that you are lazy or lack will power- but you really had tried very hard to diet but they just don’t work. you feel more lethargic and tired than ever- it gets worst as time goes by. the authors themselves had tried so many fad diets and methods and still put on weight. They had suffered years of prejustice from society till they discovered how their bodies reacted to sugar and starches. Dr Rachael herself lost 186 pounds and does not suffer from food craving or deprivation. She kept the weight off for more than 10yrs. the author introduces reward meals- so if you really must have that candy bar, you may have it once- at night. For some people, the night candy bar may start off another eating binge. by eating food that stabilises your blood sugar instead of driving it haywire, you will lose weight and what’s more, it is a eating lifestyle that you can follow for life. Before I even read this book, I had the suspicion that my sweet tooth could be the culprit of my tireness and being overweight. In April 07, then I was lucky to have found the book “Win the Sugar War” by Holly McCord. The book feature 100 real life stories of people whose life were changed when they cut off sugar. I felt so cheated by my sweet tooth that I started this blog to document my journey. he scientist in me did some research and testing- observing for my ownself how taking refined sugar and starch affects my body (increased tiredness, irritability, mood swings), I realised that my body reacts negatively with high sugar intake. That’s why by the time I am reading this book, I knew what is mentioned in the book is very true for carbo addicts. It is not just another fad but it is something that you can stick to for life. (update 2008: now take sugar as I was able to regularise my condition through exercise. But I still believe during the initial stage, it’s best to minimize refined carbs from your diet unless you are physically very active.). So far, my weight only dropped only about 1.5kg (since May). The drop in weight was not significant but I am starting to be able to fit into clothings that previously were just too tight for me. The regular exercise and resistance training helped- muscle makes you weight heavier. Now I seldom suffer from food craving. Also feel more energetic. I am no longer addicted to teh tarik or coffee from restaurants and mamak- the fatigue that I know I will feel after that is just not worth it. Pyschologically, I am also changing- I no longer want to be disorganised. I enjoy tidying and decluttering my home and office desk- bit by bit. I feel much more in control of my life now. noodles, rice, white bread, pasta, pita bread- anything made from wheat. Take more fruits and vegetable, best raw. No dressing, please. Use fruits (oranges, grapes), dried apricots, other raw vege as snacks- learn to pack your own snacks. If you don’t know, most ready cut fruits that you buy from outside are dipped into saccharin/sugar water to make it taste sweet- so it will drive your cravings if you eat them. Trust me, if you try it, YOUR LIFE WILL REALLY CHANGE FOR THE BETTER. Take the first step- rise to the challenge.

Turbinenbräu, a small brewery from Switzerland’s financial capital Zurich, inadvertently triggered anger and protests from Nepalese citizens after one of its beers, which is brewed with Timut pepper, a spice associated with Nepal, was named after King Birendra, whose legacy is still hotly contested despite the overthrow of the monarchy ten years ago. “I was looking for a Nepalese name that does not sound trite, like Everest,” Adrien Weber, the managing director of Turbinenbräu, told Swiss newspaper Tagesanzeiger. Finally he chose the name Birendra, because it is unique and it sounds similar to beer, he said. Birendra Bir Bikram Shah was the King of Nepal from 1972 until June 1, 2001, when Birendra and eight members of the Royal Family were massacred at a royal dinner. According to the official version, mentally disturbed Crown Prince Dipendra committed suicide after gunning down almost all of the Royal family. One of the few survivors was Birendra’s brother Gyanenda, who took the throne but had to step down in 2008 thus ending 240 years of Nepalese monarchy. “King Birendra is an immortal figure capturing millions of Nepalis’ hearts. Depicting him as an alcoholic beverage consumer and using his name for commercial purposes by a beverage company is highly condemnable,” said Mohan Shrestha, spokesperson for Rastriya Prajatantra Party-Nepal. Turbinenbräu was established in 1997 by former employees of Hürlimann, the last remaining brewery in Zurich, which was closed the same year. It is today the biggest brewery in the Canton of Zurich and belongs to the founders and about 400 minority shareholders.
Scouters are my friends. I love what we do and the people who help me do it. A Scout is helpful and I enjoy helping others. We share common goals. Time flies when I’m on a campout, at summer camp or just talking to other parents behind the scenes at a troop meeting. I don’t like missing campouts or troop meetings if I’m sick or otherwise can’t make it. I like to be there to support the Scouts and the troop. Scouting helps me “recharge” for the week ahead and gives me inspiration to do better outside of Scouting. I enjoy helping others succeed and recognizing them for it. I’ll do a bit more if it helps the boys. Other Scouters and parents may sometimes be troublesome but they don’t bother me because I’m focused on the boys. I look for ways that we can support the boys rather than finding ways to tell them “no”. I always keep the main aim in mind – the aims of the movement – and realize that I make a difference, no matter how small. Let us know in the comments if there are any more ways you enjoy Scouting, based on Derek’s list, my list or your own experience. Next PostNext Don’t do it halfway!

Here’s a recent chat we had with James Sutherland, owner of 56 North, a gin and cocktail bar located in Edinburgh. A: First tried it at the 2016 Juniper Gin Festival, then met with Karen and Nathan to help with the tonic launch. A: Friendly and easy to deal with. They want to sell nice products to nice people and are always enthusiastic and keen to work with others. The story of the brand and how it’s back is the very sort of thing I love in the drinks industry. Q: What’s your favourite flavour? A: The tonic is the key one for me. It’s light, fresh and works well with a wide variety of great gins. Q: Favourite way to drink/pair Bon Accord? A: Good gin, loads of ice, big goblet and then a bottle of the tonic. I’ve got so many gins to play with the sky’s the limit!
Pond Square Chapel, built in 1859, is a mere punctuation mark in the history of religious Dissent in Highgate, with a strong Puritan connection in the village before close associates of Oliver Cromwell took up residence here under the Commonwealth. The building has not changed much in the centuries past, but a major refurbishment in 1984 on the inside of the church allowed the space to become more versatile. As well as religious services, it plays host to musical concerts, lectures, public meetings, exhibitions of painting. When at the chapel, dont forget to look up at the beautiful Rose Window!

Don't know much about this. A friend got me some bud wood after describing a Hass seedling planted by a friend. The tree is now 10 years old and bears heavily, large pound size fruit, with Hass like taste. I don't even have a picture but this friend is a reliable source of information. If I'm not mistaken it matures around March in California. I Just hope one of these seedlings may like our So. Florida weather. I have top worked a tree in the grove on February 14. I also I have a back up in 3 gal. which seems to be doing well. In 3 years we may have a fruit to taste. In the mean time we'll see how it likes it here. May 18, 2013. Top worked tree is doing well, also 2 potted grafts doing well. November 1, 2013: The tree survived the heat and rain this summer. Seems to be growing well. December 31, 2013: The tree is looking good, building flower buds. See today's pictures. Curiously this tree is ahead of the Hass in the Flowering process. February 27, 2014: Expanding inflorescence, should have open flowers in 3-4 days ans we will see flower type. The tree is only one year post grafting. The top of the tree has no flowers because I pruned it a few months ago and is just pushing vegetation with force. Some location on the side only pushing vegetation. Typical first year, with some luck we could see fruit. April 4, 2014: I see a couple of very small fruit. Let's hope they set and grow. Does not seem likely. November 8, 2014: Seems like the few fruit it set still is hanging in, a little larger than Hass. Not sure when to pick this. In Cal. the fruit stays in the tree over 12 months. I don't know if it would do that here. December 26, 2014: Picked one of the two fruit on the tree. They seemed to be getting dull. It came in at 8.5 oz. Nice size for a Hass growing in Florida. Let see how it ripens. January 13, 2015: The two fruits did not ripened properly. The tree is building flower buds will give it one more year. February 3, 2015: The tree has a few open flowers. March 3, 2015: Has a lot of open flowers seems to be going slow at it. I see fruit set in the top flowers. May 21, 2015: The tree has set quite a bit of fruit and its growing it well, seem to be ahead than regular Hass. No fruit drop. June 14, 2015: The tree is holding the fruit well, good fruit set for its second flowering. Seems to be earlier than Hass sightly bigger. September 19, 2015: The fruit does not seem to be growing a lot from the observation in June. Rare, because the heat is up and has rained a lot in the last 6 weeks. Some fruit is small others larger....Dwarfism ? Like Hass? October 18, 2015: A lot of small fruit has dropped. What is in the tree seem to be growing very little. I picked the fruit in today's picture, came in at 7.8 oz this is like a larger supermarket Hass. It does have larger fruit than my regular Hass, but the Hass is more prolific. October 26, 2015: The fruit picked did not ripen well, typical problems of small Guatemalan fruit in this area. All sorts of flesh deterioration, uneven ripening, watery, sub cutaneous watery spots or rot. Reminds me of the Florida Hass problems, See today's pictures.
This past weekend, we took a trip with D's parents to a distillery. In fact, it is the only whiskey distillery in the state! Sons of Liberty opened in 2011, and originally released a whiskey and they called it Uprising. D's dad had picked some up last summer for D's bachelor party, and it was such a smooth whiskey, and they really enjoyed it. So, when we first got to the distillery, we were greeted by Danny, who is the sales manager, but also does tours when he's not on the road. He showed us through the distillery, which actually isn't that big, but the key thing to it is that it is efficient. Danny explained that they make their whiskey from beer. He showed us the four types of hops that they use to brew the beer, and explained that the only difference between the four types is how long they are roasted, similar to coffee beans. Next, he had us open up the lids to the holding containers, where the beer was fermenting. The first container had such a strong smell, almost like tequila, but that's because it hadn't been distilled a second time yet. The second container was really cool, because it smelled like beer, and you could actually see the active yeast on the top fermenting the beer. Next on the tour was the roasting pot, where they roast the hops to get the flavors that they want, and then add in the water to start the distilling process. Next, we were shown the actual still where the whiskey is made. The thing is huge, and was custom designed by the owner of Sons of Liberty, Michael, and the company that he designed the still with is now selling them on the floor. As you can tell from the picture below, the still is large enough to actually get into, which they do every so often for cleaning. The four windows that you see on the pipe allow you to see the level of which the liquid is at, and there are gauges all over the different pipes so that they can read the levels of alcohol. Danny also talked with us about how they make their vodka, which is done using the same machines that they use to make the whiskey. For their flavored vodkas, they use all natural ingredients and actually do all of the work themselves. One of their flavored vodkas is Mint Cucumber, and they sat around together and zested over 500 cucumbers by hand and de-stemmed mint leaves just to create the flavor. They were actually asking if we knew of any different cucumber recipes that they could use because after their zesting parties, they have all these unused cucumber cores and don't know what to do with them! After our tour was over, we went up to the bar to do the tasting. You may know that I'm not really a drinker, so I was unsure of how much I would enjoy the process. But, I really enjoyed it. The bartender, Brian, was great, and was so helpful in giving us information about the different spirits. We tried the Uprising Whiskey, which we had all already had before, and while it was too strong for my liking, since I don't really do hard alcohols, especially whiskey, it was smoother than others I have had before. We were also told about the different seasonal spirits that they make. Last year, they made a Single Malt Whiskey, and sold all 900 bottles that they made. Another seasonal flavor that they created was the Pumpkin Spice Whiskey which was apparently also a really big hit. Danny, the salesman, told us that as of three weeks ago, there were only 4 bottles left in the state! I was really looking forward to trying that one, since I love pumpkin, but they didn't even have a bottle for themselves! After the whiskies, we moved onto the vodkas. I'm not a huge fan of vodka, but I must say that I did really enjoy these. The regular vodka was strong, but still was good. The seasonal vodkas, however, were my favorite. The first one was the Mint Cucumber Vodka, which I mentioned previously. You really get a strong cucumber flavor at the first taste, but the after taste is where the mint comes in. It's such a fresh taste, especially for me not liking cucumber! Brian told us that making a mojito with this vodka would be perfect because of the mint, but would also add a little surprise in there with the cucumber flavoring. The second vodka was my absolute favorite! It's Dark Chocolate and Vanilla Bean Vodka. The smell of it is just so chocolatey, but the after taste is where you really get the vanilla flavor. Danny wanted us to taste it in a mixed drink, so he ended up taking some and mixing it up with Rum Chata, which is a Caribbean Rum with real Dairy Cream. When you originally smell it, it smells like carrot cake, which I just happen to love. The Rum Chata really brought out the vanilla flavor, and it was absolutely delicious! I loved it, and ended up taking D's too, since he's not a fan of carrot cake, and didn't really enjoy the combination. That was the last drink that we sampled, and our experience at Sons of Liberty was awesome. We will definitely be going back, because the staff and experience were awesome! Part of the tasting was the Sons of Liberty glass, which has already gotten great use, because I went to the liquor store the next day and stocked up. I got a bottle of the Dark Chocolate and Vanilla Bean Vodka, and a small bottle of the Rum Chata, so I could make my own drinks. While I was at the liquor store, I also walked over to the whiskey section and as I was browsing, I found the Pumpkin Spice whiskey sitting on the top shelf! We were told that this liquor store was one of the ones that still had it, but given that those numbers were accurate three weeks ago, I was skeptical that it would still be on the shelf. We really lucked out though! We ended up trying that one out too, and it was really good! I'm looking forward to Fall so I can enjoy some seasonal drinks with it. So that was our trip to the distillery. If any of you are local or will be traveling through the area, I highly recommend that you check this place out. I doubt that you will be disappointed. I have been excited to paint rooms since before the day we started looking at houses. Painting your house just helps so much to make it more personal and feel homey. I tend to do all of my house planning on my computer or iPad, but with paint colors, you really should do that with paint chips, as monitor lighting can change the look of a color drastically. But, since I'm so technology obsessed, I did a little of both. Knowing what colors I wanted to use, I checked out the Sherwin-Williams website and started picking out colors that I knew I wanted to use. You have already seen the Family Room design plan, so you know that I picked those colors out a while back. Already having this room set, I knew that choosing the other colors for the first floor had to be done carefully, since the purple and the yellow are so bold. To make the color choices really easy to see, I decided to insert them onto the floor plan of the house. This is really helpful when choosing paint colors for your house, because you don't want all of the colors that you choose to end up clashing or looking terrible. There were some things that I already knew what color I wanted, so those were easy. I new that I wanted gray and orange in my craft room, which will be in the smaller bedroom. That was an easy choice. Next was the front door, and after seeing the picture below, I knew I had to have a deep purple door. And the plus side of having a purple door is that it will match with the new paint on the exterior of the house, the new roof, and the stone work that is currently on the outside of the house. A common color that will be used throughout the house, in both furniture and paint, is white. Unfortunately, that doesn't help narrow down many color choices for us, so I thought about things that inspired me. I found a navy blue duvet cover at Target while I was picking up the side table for the Family Room, and since it was on clearance, I bought it. This ended up becoming the inspiration piece for the navy blue, green, and white color palette in the bigger bedroom in the corner, which will end up being a guest bedroom. To match with the front door, I wanted a lighter contrasting color, so I decided to go with two different shades of green, and I have plans to do vertical stripes along both hallways above the chair molding and paneling. The full bathroom on this floor is almost entirely brown, which I think needs to change. So I chose a beautiful shade of teal that I think will complement the space and design perfectly. The last room on this floor was the Living Room. Since this space is so huge, we plan to use it as both a living area and a more formal dining area. I had originally picked out a light blue and a dark coral for this room, but after lining everything up on the floor plan, I realized that the coral color really clashed with the orange. So, after pulling some colors that I have already used in other rooms, I finally found the color palette for the entire first floor. I know there are a lot of colors there, but I'm not afraid of it being too much. I'm just so excited to start painting and decorating. I can't wait to actually be proud to show off our home! A few months back, I got a call at work from my mom, who was at home, and she said that the fire alarms had gone off three times so far that morning. Apparently when they decide to go off, they not only make that annoying and loud beeping noise, but there's also a woman's voice that starts saying "fire" over and over again. Except she doesn't say it like you and I would normally. She really emphasizes the second syllable, so it's more like "fi-YER." Kind of funny, actually. But anyways, the fire department came and checked everything out, and cleared the house, saying that there were no fire or carbon monoxide issues. The fire alarms didn't go off again... until my dad got home from work a few hours later. My dad did some investigating, and found that one of the smoke/carbon detectors seemed to be the one triggering the others, so he took it down, and that seemed to have stopped the problems. I called our electrician and he came over and took a look at the system and realized that not all of the detectors were linked into the same electrical system, which is apparently required for insurance purposes. Also, there were no detectors in any of the bedrooms, and some of them were battery operated. We ended up scheduling a time for him to rewire the fire alarms, and add in new ones where they were needed, and we hadn't had any issues since then. I was at work once again, so my mom and my sister did some investigating, and there was one that was triggering the others again. They disconnected it from the ceiling and the others haven't triggered on again, so it looks like we have another culprit. I'm going to have to buy a replacement at the hardware store this weekend to see if that solves some problems. Has anyone else experienced anything like this? Are we doing the right thing by unplugging the culprit? It just makes me nervous because it doesn't seem like those things should just go off without there being an issue, you know? Help! You've heard me mention a few times before that we have a great desire to renovate our kitchen. But, that's at least two years down the line, as there are other things that we would like to get done first. In the meantime, however, we want to do something that makes it look a little better and to personalize it a bit. The thing that I hate the most about our kitchen is the backsplash. It's this really ugly peach colored ceramic tile that has a few printed tiles laid into the design. Some of them have wine bottles and grapes on them, and that is definitely not our style. I started researching cheap and easy alternatives to change this out, as we don't want something that will be too involved or expensive, as it will likely be changed again in a few years when we completely renovate the kitchen. I looked at a few different materials. The first one that I found was AirStone. AirStone is a product that is made from recycled materials, and is meant to look like actual stones. They come in a variety of sizes, and adhere to the surface that you want to place them on via an adhesive mortar. These look awesome, but for the amount that we would need, it would be just over $100, and while that is still really inexpensive, it was more than we wanted to spend. The second material that I looked at was Tin Ceiling Tiles, which are also adhesive. These come in great textures, colors, and patterns, but the price for a single tile was way more expensive than we wanted. Plus, I wasn't so sure about how good a shiny metal backsplash would look against a matte finish Corian countertop. The last material I found was vinyl floor tile. With the vinyl floor tile, you have the option of going with a solid color, or choosing one with dimension and different textures. Another benefit of the vinyl was that it was cheap, it was adhesive, like the other materials, and it didn't require additional caulking. With this in mind, we went over to Lowes this weekend and picked out a few different colors and patterns and bought sample tiles to bring home and test against the cabinets and countertops. The samples are actually real tiles, which you can purchase from as little as $.88 or as much as $2.25. We ended up coming home with 7 different tiles, and chose which one we were going to go with less than two minutes after leaning them up over the existing backsplash. The one that we ended up choosing was the most expensive one, of course. Everything that I like always ends up costing a million dollars, but in this case, we're still going to end up right where we wanted to be budget wise. Even though these tiles are $2.25 each, they are 18"x18", instead of 12"x12", Which means that we won't need to buy as many cases and there will be much less cutting involved since the height of our backsplash is 18". So, you can see that the tile has a lot of gray, so it will go with the white cabinets and the stainless steel appliances, but it also has some tans and browns in it, so it will go with the countertops, too. We have plans to paint this room this summer, so the gray that we have chosen for that will match as well. What do you think? Do you think this small change will make a drastic difference in our kitchen? I am so looking forward to doing this, and don't worry, I'll make you all a DIY!! When D and I moved back to RI from Indiana, we sold our living room furniture, and trashed the 23+ year old couch and love seat that were gifted to us from D's parents. They had seen much better days! We were going to be living with them, and didn't need living room furniture, plus, most of the stuff was hand-me-down and mismatched anyways. I recently sat down and started brainstorming how to furnish and decorate the Family Room, which will be the first priority when they move out. I am really inspired by The High Low Project, on HGTV, where the host, Sabrina Soto decorates a room with no budget, and then tries to recreate it for under the budget set by the homeowners, which is typically around $3-5K. Considering that we are starting with absolutely nothing, no couch, no chairs, and no TV, we are going to try to stay under $4K for the whole project. Here's what I've come up with so far! I fell in love with the Henry set from West Elm, but the three pieces that we wanted, the couch, oversized chair, and ottoman, would immediately be more than half the budget! After searching high and low for some modern looking gray living room furniture, I finally found a really nice looking set at a local furniture store, called Bob's Discount Furniture. What you need to know next is that I have an obsession with IKEA. It's bad, and I know it. Admitting that is the first step though, right? Anyways, this room wouldn't be complete without something from IKEA, and there will be plenty, but the first piece will be an Expedit. I know. Everyone has one. But, we're going to use it as a TV stand, and I'm going to hack it. I have plans to remove the middle divider on the top row so we have a place to put the TV receiver/DVR, and I also plan to add legs to it so that the TV is a little higher off the ground. As I was searching for rugs, I came across this absolutely gorgeous and dark purple color, and immediately knew that I wanted that in the room. It's a high pile rug, which I am kind of concerned about with having cats, but I think it will be alright. You may have seen this pin on Pinterest, and I knew that I wanted to recreate that look. But, I searched and searched, and couldn't find any metal trash cans that were pretty enough to do this, so I started looking at actual side tables and found this one from Target! Later, after some research, I found out that the table in the inspiration picture is actually a table from Target and not a trash can, so I guess it was meant to be. I have plans to spray paint it our accent color - primary yellow! Lastly, a few DIY projects. I love love love the look of poufs, but I really do not like the price tag at all. So, I'm going to DIY my own. It will also be primary yellow, although I am having a hard time finding thick enough and cheap enough yarn or something to make it from. I was recently thinking about how I could use rope, or even a bedsheet though. We'll see what I decide. We currently have a 2' wall clock in the family room, but it's a much more traditional style, and we're looking for something a bit more modern. Without getting into the hundreds of dollars, we are going to DIY our own clock, which will end up being just over 3' in diameter. We're going to base it on this design, but make some modifications to it that we think would better fit our space. There are more pieces of furniture that we have chosen, and some accessories, but this is the plan for the most part. Also, for the DIY items, I'll be sure to write up the directions and do a post for each one. I'm really excited for the project! So excited, in fact, that I put everything into Photoshop to see how it would look together. I think it's looking awesome so far! I can't wait to actually get it started! What do you think? Now that you've seen the Master Bedroom in our house, you can tell that I had a major dilemma on my hands. There are four double-windows in the bedroom, one in the closet, and one in the bathroom plus the bay window above the hot tub. If you add all of those up, that means that I would need 9 curtain rods, and 18 brackets. Curtains were a must, as we have neighbors that can see in the windows at night when the lights are on. Also, they make the room look nice! So, looking online, I quickly figured out that it was going to cost me well over $200 dollars just for curtain rods, and I was actually looking at more like $300 for the style that I wanted. Now, I'm a major DIY-er, so I immediately tried to come up with ideas as to how I could make this a cheap and fun project. So, I did some research and decided to make my own curtains AND brackets! I took a trip to Lowes with my dad, and borrowed my sister's SUV, and we bought the supplies. First, we went to the Electrical aisle, and took a look at the electrical conduit. It was going to work perfectly. Now, you have some options in size when buying conduit for your curtain rods. They come in 1/2", 3/4" and 1" diameters. I ended up choosing the 1", which is slightly more expensive, but would look better with the size of the grommets in the curtains I was eyeing. Next, we went to the pipe-fittings aisle, and I got all the parts for the brackets. All I needed were conduit hooks (make sure you get the ones that are made for the diameter of conduit you chose). Lastly, was the hardware aisle, where I picked up some wing-nuts, some metal screws, and some "L" brackets. The "L" brackets should come with their own mounting screws. Make sure you keep those, because that's what you'll attach these to the wall with. Once we got home, it was assembly time! I started with the brackets. I got all my stuff together, and then got to work. Each bracket will be made of one of each of the items listed above. So, I took one of each item from my supplies, and started putting them together. Take the conduit hook and line up the screw hole on the flat part with one of the screw holes on the end of the "L" bracket. Put your screw through to hold them together. Attach your wing-nut to the other side of the screw and start winding it up to tighten the screw around the two pieces. You may want to use a pair of pliers to tighten the wing-nut as much as possible. And that's that! One bracket down and now 17 to go! Really quick though! Now, I'll show you the curtain rods. It makes it really easy to cut the pipe if you have the ability to anchor it down, so what D and I did was bring it outside, and lay it diagonally across two chairs, and then we each sat down on an end. We had measured out how long we needed the first part of the pipe to be for one of the windows, and I marked it with permanent marker. We took the conduit cutter, placed the blade on the mark, and started twisting around the pipe. You can see how we stopped mid-cut so I could show you the indentation that the cutter was making. Depending on the brand, your cutter may tell you otherwise, but we tightened the blade after every rotation, and after less than two minutes, we had made our first clean cut. After we made all the cuts, we brought the pipes upstairs, made marks on the wall where we wanted the brackets to be, and screwed them into the wall using two screws from the "L" bracket package. I took the curtains that I bought and hemmed, looped them onto the pipes, and then clipped our electrical conduit curtain rods into place. These curtain rods will not have finials, as you may have noticed, but you can get creative and use just about anything as finials. We have plans to spray paint wooden balls and attach them to the end of ours, but you could also buy normal curtain finials and attach them, or even use grapevine balls, painted different colors (I actually plan to do this in another room in my house!). And now for the final reveal! Open curtains - with massive glare! So, the grand total for this project. Ready? Less than $80! Yes! For real! I spent less than $80 on everything I needed for this project. Totally awesome, especially considering I had 9 curtain rods and 18 brackets to make! Now, go out to your local hardware store and save yourself some money! Ok, so you've seen the first floor and the second floor of our house. Now it's time to see the last part, the basement and the yard. The basement was fully finished at one point, but as of right now, it is no longer. We purchased the house with knowledge that there were some mold issues in the basement because of a previous water issue, so we've had to do some work down there to get rid of the mold. The basement was high priority on our list when we first purchased the house, but it's kind of taken a back burner now. But, here we go! Like I did with the rest of the house, here is a floor plan of the basement. I didn't have Microsoft Visio with me at the time, so I used Microsoft Word and made a legend at the bottom that explains what each thing is. When you walk down the stairs to the basement from the hallway on the first floor, you come down into the open space in the basement. The area is really, really big, measuring at just about 700 square feet! There is an area closer to the utility room and there is also an area where there is a door that leads up a steep flight of stairs to the backyard. Behind the stairs that go up to the main floor, there is a closet, which is really oddly shaped, but has a bookshelf in it, in addition to the deeper storage space that actually runs underneath the staircase. You can see in the floor plan above that there is actually a bedroom down here too. The bedroom is a really good size, and just to give you an idea of it's placement, it is directly underneath the bigger bedroom on the first floor of the house. The bedroom even has a small walk-in closet, but the doors are currently removed for mold remediation. When the time comes, I'll paint them white to match the rest of the moulding and then hang them back up. Through the doorway next to the shower stall is the laundry room, which is actually a really good size. There is a folding table and a space for the washer and dryer. There are no appliances in the pictures below, but you can see in the floor plan above where they are currently located. Eventually, we'd like to change the water line and electrical for the washer and dryer and get them closer to each other, but that's not absolutely necessary right now, so we're living with the current layout. And that's it for the basement. So, we'll move onto the back yard. While the property is small, at just about 1/4 acre, it's the perfect size for us without being too much work. The backyard is so cute though. First, the door from the basement looks like this. Please keep in mind that the house has been completely repainted now, and that these pictures are from before we closed on the property. To the right of this picture is the small yard part of the backyard. The yard is completely fenced in, and has great arborvitaes along most of the fence for added privacy. You can tell from the last picture that I was standing on the deck, so now I'll show you what that looks like. The deck is really cute. It's not that high off the ground, which I like, and it has a built-in bench that goes around on two sides for additional seating. I think for safety's sake, we're going to build a back for the bench, and then I'll make some outdoor cushions for comfort. Now that the house is painted, we also have plans to paint the deck, as the two different shades of gray don't go together very well, and we want to brighten up the space a little bit. When standing on the deck and looking straight ahead into the yard, we have a non-fruit producing pear tree, which is absolutely gorgeous. This picture also shows two of the three additional Poplar trees growing along the fence, but we had all three of them removed because not only were they breaking the fence, but they were so tall and hanging over our back-neighbor's house, and we didn't want that liability. I can't wait to see this pear tree in bloom this Spring! I know that I have shown you some pictures of the front of the house before, but these show off a bit more of the landscaping, which will all likely be changed in the Spring. There are a lot of shrubs right along the house and not only are they not very attractive, but they also are too close to the siding and are causing problems, so we'll be taking care of that soon too. Some of these pictures were also taken before the house was painted and the roof was replaced, so please keep that in mind. This next picture is of the kitchen addition and front porch by the driveway. You can really see how overgrown the bushes and shrubs are along this part of the house. This next picture is of the corner of the original part of the house and the addition. Again, needs weeding badly, and some grooming overall. I know that the stone on the house looks very brown, but it's not actually that brown. When you look closer, there is a lot of gray, and some dark purples too, which is why we decided to go with a darker gray paint color for the wood siding. I actually really love the stone facade. And now for the front of the house. This first picture is before the painting and roof were done. During.... Painting done, roofing not. This concludes our house tour! What do you think? I am so glad that we decided to get the house painted and the roof redone. It makes it look so much better right off the bat. Now for all the other projects that we want to accomplish! The list never ends when you're a homeowner, right?!

Hi my name is Alex Eliades and this is my personal blog. I spent most of my life in various parts of the UK but currently I live in Cyprus (now back in London). Im not ashamed to admit that Im a bit of a geek and probably spend far too much time in front of my laptops. I help to run an online Forex and CFD brokerage and own a few websites that I run in my spare time. If Im not working Im generally with the wife, doing DIY or riding my bike in the countryside. Ive had a passion for the Internet ever since it helped radically change my life in the early naughties (2000s) but thats a long story. For some reason I often find myself tinkering around with Linux, web applications, cars or crypto-currencies in my spare time. I believe in setting goals, openness, sharing ideas, efficiency, education, honesty, equality, statistics and a long list of other stuff that define who I am. I am an advocate of the paperless office, promoting young people, environmental and social responsibility, giving credit where its due and helping people when I can. In my eyes the most successful people are the ones that can identify strengths in others, then encourage and inspire them to do work they are good at. I graduated with a bachelors degree in Business IT from Portsmouth University in the UK, then went on to start a career in software solution sales but after some years realised that it wasn’t my calling in life. The fact that I was a closet techie and developed websites in my spare time was probably a sign that my future didn’t lie in sales. Anyway it was an awesome ride, I travelled all over the UK and met loads of interesting people on the way. The turning point came during my time working at a cool web agency in Tech City, East London with some really inspirational people, not to mention my just as inspirational friends that were close to me back then. During my time there I discovered affiliate marketing, learned a bit about SEO and was surrounded by techies, usability gurus and digital strategists. It was at this point I knew that my future was with the web and I created my first website that produced me a regular income after leaving. I moved to Cyprus, worked for the family business and built up my affiliate business. In 2013 I landed a job doing marketing for an online FX & CFD business. I have worked alongside some industry veterans and learned all I could about this fascinating business. I now work in this field on an outsourced basis while also handling a few personal web projects and I thoroughly enjoy my work. My favourite music includes modern jazz, chill-out, lounge, dance and rock type genres depending on my mood. I used to love watching films but now prefer streaming TV series and my recent favourites include Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, Prison Break, The BlackList, The Mentalist, Narcos and Person of Interest. I love being under the sun, outdoors and in a natural environment, especially by (or in) the sea on a hot summers day. My favourite quote is “There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self” by Ernest Hemingway. The reason I like it is because I agree we should always look to improve ourselves and not be compelled with comparing ourselves to others. London is one of the most impressionable places I have lived because the place is alive, full of people at the top of their game and I was lucky enough to have met a load of forward thinking people, which I hope rubbed off on me a bit. Limassol is another massively impressionable City where I lived as my years there helped me understand myself, others and what is really important in life (somethings you just dont learn in London!). Hanoi is another city I visited on numerous occasions and it really woke me up when I saw how people live on the other side of the world. I produced this blog so I could keep a journal and share my interests, ideas and experience with the world or at least anyone that is interested enough to read it!

ABC Russian: How to say "I'm sorry" in Russian? How to say "I'm sorry" in Russian? You can use both in a range of situations, from such light offenses as bumping into someone to something graver, such as spoiling a surprise. If you are interrupting someone with a question, as when you ask for directions, it is only polite to start with извините. If you are saying this to a person with whom you would use an informal ты (informal you), you would say прости or извини.
Now, just because the title says 5 days in Rome, that doesn’t mean … this post is in fact just part 2 of day 3. But you weren’t thinking that, of course. After the Catacombs of St. Callixtus on the Appian Way, we headed out to the Basilica di San Paolo fuori le Mura (St. Paul outside the Walls), one of the major papal basilicas in Rome. It is also here we would celebrate our second mass on pilgrimage. Msgr. Dreiling was still in the hospital, and the musicians from OLPH in Fresno CA came prepared, under the direction of Ruben Cabatic. They livened up the liturgy indeed. Notable at St. Paul’s are the mosaic portraits of all 266 bishops of Rome … and says Eleonora our city guide, “There have never been two living popes, so it is more than unusual to have both Papa Francesco and Papa Ratzi up there at the same time.” I didn’t think that was so unusual at all. I think she meant she hadn’t ever seen it in her lifetime. Then in the evening, dinner at La Vittoria with Lois, Marta & Jim. Here are some of the dishes we enjoyed … unless we enjoyed it first, so I didn’t remember to take a pic.

A shark has died after tourists and lifeguards were video taped pulling it from sea, just so they could pose for photos with it. They dragged the shark from the waves to the beach, trapping its head in a rubber ring while laughing as it starts floundering and suffocates. Apparently, the video was filmed in the Dominican Republic, with lifeguards from Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Punta Cana. Pictures posted on social media show a number of Hard Rock Hotel staff smiling as they lean over the dying shark. We can only hope that people will start to finally value animals lives, more than their pursuit for a perfect selfie.

New Mexico’s medical cannabis industry is about to get bigger, though it’s unclear by how much. The state’s health department has chosen 17 finalists out of 86 applicants for new MMJ producer licenses, according to The Associated Press. There’s no word yet on how many of those 17 will actually be awarded licenses. But Retta Ward, New Mexico’s secretary of health, is expected to make a decision on the matter within the next 30 days, the AP reported. At the beginning of the year, there were 24 nonprofit dispensaries and 23 licensed producers in the entire state (licensees are allowed to run more than one dispensary). Some of the factors that played into officials’ decision when culling the field of applicants included plans for security, production, quality assurance, sales and distribution, and agricultural experience.
Memorizing this verse was an assignment my father, the minister, gave to a class of 7-9 year olds at Piney River Church of Christ near Dickson, TN. The language of the King James version made the message was largely unaccessible to me. I understood the general gist of the verse – that scripture was written to teach us about God’s love – but not its connection to the rest of this passage. Paul is writing to Christians in Rome encouraging unity and willingness to love and serve one another. He refers to the Old Testament which was more familiar to early Christians than it is to many of us. He wanted his audience to understand that Jesus, the root of Jesse, is the hope of all the world. God’s incredible power came into the world through Jesus and the salvation and forgiveness he offers. The joy and peace of trusting in God is available to all believers. God sends his Spirit among us to transform our lives and empower each of us to do what we can to be the change God dreams for the world.

Sometime last year, Bet Yindee, a young woman with short hair and a quick smile, walked into a Muay Thai gym in the Sathorn area of Bangkok and told the trainers she wanted to try a sample session. One of the trainers watched her form, remarked that she had good technique and asked where she learned Muay Thai. "Is it good?" he asked. "Do you like training there?" "No," she said. "It's too small." The trainer laughed, said he used to fight under the Petchyindee promotion, though not the gym itself, years ago when he was a young fighter in Bangkok. Bet kept quiet about her very close association with Petchyindee, the gym she had put down as being "too small." During the entire session, the trainer never once recognized her as a member of the famous Petchyindee family. Bet was there as a spy. Her family was building a new gym, a much bigger one than their old location at the recently-razed Lumpinee Stadium. Bet was on a mission to see how other gyms in Bangkok handled training and marketing. The Sathorn gym was just one of a few she planned to check out. She later told her family what she'd observed at the Sathorn gym that day, what they did well, what she thought the new Petchyindee could do better. Her father listened to her ideas, thankful she'd agreed to work for her family. Petchyindee, well-known across Thailand, is partially run by a team of siblings: now in their mid and late twenties respectively, Bet and her older brother Boat Yindee are slowly taking over the Petchyindee brand. Petchyindee is a famous name in traditional Thai boxing, but this new incarnation of the "Petchyindee Kingdom" is not limited just to the sport. The new facility, parts of which are still under construction, also offers hotel-style accommodations, a restaurant, spa, and fitness center. Petchyindee's new one-stop-style facility is part of a recent shift in Muay Thai culture, with gyms and entrepreneurs looking to capitalizing on Muay Thai's growing popularity among the middle- and upper-class Thai demographic. Petchyindee houses a sauna to help fighters cut weight, as well as masseuses and a spa, aimed at what Bet called "people from the stadium who like to watch Muay Thai," which I took to mean Muay Thai fans, most likely gamblers. The gym also offers group classes for non-fighters, mostly businessmen, students, and "women who want to lose weight," as Bet says. "I'm not sure why they want to do Muay Thai, but maybe it's more fun than going to a regular fitness gym." Bet attributes the rising interest in Muay Thai among average, non-fighting, non-gambling Thais to stars like Buakaw. Her brother Boat agrees, and calls Buakaw a major pop-cultural draw for Muay Thai. "His fighting style is really entertaining," Boat says. "He's okay as a fighter, but his acting in the ring is great, better than his technique." Both Boat and Bet point to large, televised promotions like Thai Fight and World Muay Thai Angels as fueling the popularity of Muay Thai among non-traditional audiences. The Petchyindee siblings aren't huge fans of Thai Fight and will tell you as much, but Bet looks to World Muay Thai Angels as an example of what her family gym's future promotions could be. "Angels did a great job with their graphic design and their marketing. On the TV, the stage, the entire production, I liked the design of it. That's why I watched it, because I wanted to see how they were doing their program and graphic design." When I asked Bet her opinion on the female fighters having to wear makeup during the World Muay Thai Angels promotion, the conversation veered to a discussion of her gym's male fighters' fashion and grooming, not a topic I commonly hear. After deciding her fighters needed haircuts, she paid her own hairdresser 7,000 baht (US $200) to come to the gym and cut everyone's hair. "At first the fighters were all afraid," she laughed. "They thought he was going to give them cuts like a student's hairstyle," (apparently a very dorky cut for a Thai fighter), "so some of them went and got their hair cut on their own [the day before] so they wouldn't need my hairdresser. But the fighters who got their hair cut [by my hairdresser] really liked it." The fighters all seem to like Bet in general. She has a cheerful nature about her, and the fighters looked relaxed when talking to her. "Our foreign fighters call me Betty," she said. "The Thais call me Khun Bet (Miss Bet) and they always ask me to give them snacks. I get along with all of them. I'm not like Boat. He's strict, like a teacher. Except for after training; then they all play games together." On the day Bet's hairdresser visited the gym, some of the fighters even elected to have the Petchyindee diamond logo shaped into their hair. Bet showed me pictures on her smartphone of the diamond design adorning scalps. Cool way to show off your gym pride, but unfortunately that kind of hair art lasts only a few weeks before growing out. Bet had to pay her hairdresser extra for the complicated logo work. Most big-name gyms have at least some kind of logo or color scheme, but Petchyindee takes it to a new level, their diamond printed all over their black and green compound. The Petchyindee diamond is fairly complex, designed by Bet herself, in hopes of differentiating it from the diamond logos of many other gyms in Thailand. Like so many children born into families with their own businesses, Bet is working for her family's brand, though it's not necessarily a career she would have chosen for herself. "When my father first started building this new complex, I wasn't going to help him," she said. "I wanted to go to England for my master's degree, but my dad asked me to help with the gym's new signage, so I agreed to take a look at it." Bet screamed when she saw her father's proposed signage, as well as the plans for the rest of the building. "I came here and said, 'Oh no, what did you do?!' The whole thing looked like some apartment block. He didn't know it was supposed to look nice, unique. I told him, 'If you put your name on an apartment, then your brand is going to be an apartment.'" Her father asked Bet to help fix the problems as she saw them, so first she tackled the diamond logo for the sign. Then she was coerced into helping design the exterior of the building. After that, her father tasked her with putting together the training area. Bet balked, but her father said he needed her. "I didn't do the boxing area at first; that wasn't my job," she said. "But then I started doing the equipment, the floor of the rings, the logo on the ring and the ropes and gloves. Everything. It was a lot of work." The work is good, she says, but her family's business is not something she plans to do forever, hopefully not more than another year. Her brother Boat, however, is firmly entrenched in the Muay Thai world and will probably stay for life. After all, he is arguably Thailand's youngest major Muay Thai promoter in history, working closely with and/or managing the Petchyindee and Petchviset promotions, among others. Boat and Bet make a good managerial pair. He handles the fighters, the training, and the stadium promotion; she looks after the business side -- marketing, design, pretty much everything else. "My brother and I work well together but our jobs don't overlap very much," Bet said. When I asked her to elaborate, she put it in terms of the symbol of Petchyindee, the diamond. "Boat develops the boxers, helps them become famous, makes their [Muay Thai] ability like a diamond, but I'm the one who makes this diamond easy to touch. He creates the value of Petchyindee; I'm the one who shows this value to everyone. He puts it together, I bring it out."

In the 2011 season, eleven of the twenty teams going to the starting grid in the European Championship drove vehicles from MAN. They were cheered on by enthusiastic fans, for example at Nürburgring, where 212,000 spectators turned out to watch. The first championship win for Jochen Hahn is a milestone for the team. Since 2008, Jochen Hahn has been driving an MAN TGS 18.480. The origins of Team Hahn Racing go back to the year 1996. Team boss Konni Hahn was the driver in the early years until handing over the wheel to son Jochen in 2000. Starting in the 2006 season, there is a single, uniform racing class: the near-series race truck. In 2000, a new name appears on the race-truck scene: Egon Allgäuer. The Austrian, who hails from Vorarlberg, blazed the trail in driving the first MAN TG 410 A as a racing vehicle. This was in 2001 and Allgäuer took second place in the championship at his first attempt. For most of the next decade, Team Allgäuer remains one of the dominant teams, at times entering up to four MAN-based vehicles in races. 2001 In this year, MAN wins every title that FIA has to offer. Fritz Kreutzpointner, Markus Bösiger and Antonio Albacete score a 1-2-3 in the overall drivers' standings in the Super Race Trucks Class, en-suring MAN’s dominant victory in the manufacturers' standings. With this success, MAN ends its participation in the Super Race Trucks Class and re-organises its truck sport activities with effect from 2002. After his earliest experience of truck sport at the Dakar Rally, Lutz Bernau from Utting on Ammersee first competes in a truck race in 1985, at the second Grand Prix du Camion in Le Castellet. In 1995 he constructs his first race truck based on an MAN. He ends his driving career in 2005 and has since then been successfully managing other drivers as a team owner. Under his direction, Antonio Albacete wins his first European championship in the very same year. 1994 The division into three classes (A up 11.9 litres, B up to 14.1 litres and C up to 18.5 litres) applying up to then is changed to two: Race Trucks and Super Race Trucks. Race Trucks -the "small" class - are based on series vehicles, while the "big" Super Race Trucks are racing prototypes with special chassis, racing engines delivering up to 1,600 hp and other technical specialities. In this year, the series is officially sanctioned by the FIA. 1991 First European Championship (Class C) for MAN Phoenix, driver: Gerd Körber (D). In the nineties, up to 60 teams congregate on the tracks over ten race weekends. Always to be seen there: seven trucks of the MAN brand. 1989 Bickel Tuning builds the MAN Phoenix. This was specially constructed as a truck with a bonnet, licensed for both road use and racing. First outing was in November 1989 in Donington / England. Under the striking, angular bonnet of the six-tonner was an 18.4-litre V-10 twin-turbo engine delivering 1,300 hp and a torque of 4,600 Nm. Twelve race trucks and a few variants for on-road use were con-structed. For safety reasons, the end of the 1989 season sees the introduction of a speed limit of 160 kilometres per hour. 1985 The start of a new European motor-sport series: Truck Racing. First race at Nürburgring, simultaneously a new record number of spectators since the Ring was re-opened in 1983. The announcement on Sunday morning, 9am: "Sold out, 155,000 spectators!" 1981 First truck race at Le Mans / France.

Pittsburgh is jam packed with attractions for any type of tourist. The sports fan will have a ball watching any of Pittsburgh's home teams play and will be surrounded by die-hard sports fans. While ladies who may prefer to skip the game will enjoy North Side & North Shore attractions like Carnegie Science Center and the Andy Warhol Museum. Families will fall for this area as well because it's home to the Children's Museum of Pittsburgh. Hot Tips: Plan ahead when looking to score tickets to sporting events. Filled with diverse neighborhoods that are all a pleasure to explore, Pittsburgh scores points with sports fans, culture seekers, and families for the close proximity of sports venues on the North Side & North Shore. Across the Allegheny River from downtown, the North Shore and North Side house many Pittsburgh attractions such as the Carnegie Science Center, Heinz Field and PNC Park, the National Aviary, Children's Museum of Pittsburgh and the Andy Warhol Museum. Those who prefer to be more central to downtown should explore the hotel options in Pittsburgh's Downtown area or Strip District. Hot Tips: Driving around during rush hour; Pittsburgh city roads are confusing to navigate. Pittsburgh's diverse populationmake this city a diner's dream! The Strip District is lined with truly special finds, from restaurants owned by famed chefs like Italian spot Lidia's to Primanti Bros., the famous former "truck stop" that serves the most classic American sandwiches that are a full meal. But no trip to Pittsburgh is complete without a trip to Mount Washington and the Monterey Bay Fish Grotto where the food and views can't be beat. Hot Tips: Take a ride on the restored incline cars up the side of Mt. Washington, enjoy a date at the Monterey Bay Fish Grotto and ride back down after dark. Hot Tips: Primanti Bros. sandwich in the Strip District, pierogis. Nothing beats Pittsburgh's Strip District for a night out. This funky section of the city is walkable making it easy to try a few places in one night. Hot spots include Prive Ultra Lounge, and Altar Bar where dance floors are plentiful and VIP bottle service is an option for the high roller. And if you love a good dive bar, don't miss The 31st Street Pub because it can't be beat for rock 'n' roll. Hot Tips: Hot spots get crowded; arrive a little early so you're sure to get in. If you're looking to do some shopping in Pittsburgh, be sure to visit downtown and the Strip District. Downtown is a small spot packed with department stores, specialty shops and boutiques. While the Strip District is a vibrant market district filled with eclectic offerings. For a day indoors, pop into one of Pittsburgh's excellent malls where you can shop, eat and be entertained without having to weather the outdoors. Hot Tips: Station Square for shopping. There are few actual shops in Station Square. Hot Tips: Steelers or Penguins gear, Heinz merchandise, Duquesne Incline memorabilia. Five of Pittsburgh's most unique features and characteristics. It's impossible to effectively discuss Pittsburgh without giving attention to its famously diverse and down-to-earth population. Every facet of the city's unique present day culture was shaped by the ethnic traditions of countless groups of immigrants from regions like Italy, Britain, Poland, and Lithuania. While the bulk of Pittsburgh's citizens are friendly and welcoming, if you've never experienced the local dialect ("Pittsburghese"), you may find yourself flailing through conversations. For a quick crash course, remember that yinz is plural for "you" (and that people from Pittsburgh are sometimes called Yinzers) and words like "downtown" are often pronounced more like "dahntahn." Some of Pittsburgh's many museums and art installations are world-class institutions. The Oakland neighborhood is home to a series of Carnegie Museums, foremost among them the Museum of Natural History and the Museum of Art. Just around the corner from this, the Frick Art and Historical Center offers unique insight into the history of Pittsburgh's once-booming steel industry. The Andy Warhol Museum, in the Northside district, is a must-see for art-lovers and pop culture junkies alike. It features a boundless collection of Warhol's works, as well as a recreation of "the Factory" where he was headquartered for many years. Pittsburgh's long history is bound up intrinsically in the presence of its three rivers (the Allegheny, Monongahela, and the Ohio), which allowed for its formation in its earliest days, and for its post-industrial steel boom. Pittsburgh is also known as the "City of Bridges," owing to the fact that many assert it has more bridges than any city in the world (Venetians and Chattanoogans famously decry this claim, but locals are quick to dismiss them.) Many of the bridges feature stunning architecture and design, with some of the more famous being the West End Bridge, the Fort Pitt Bridge, and the Three Sisters. Pittsburgh is a city whose culinary scene comprises the holy trinity of factors: it has an excellent dining scene that is robust but not touristy, they have an array of ethnic markets and locally-owned and operated grocers, and they have a handful of signature dishes. Primanti's is your best bet for a no-frills but exceptionally hearty and delicious dining experience; they serve a renowned sandwich piled high with fries and slaw. The Strip District is where you'll find the greatest concentration of ethnic eateries and one-of-a-kind markets. And the Bloomfield neighborhood is home to some of the most authentic Italian restaurants this side of the pond. If you're looking for a city in North America that experiences four distinct seasons (think: not Miami or Alaska), head to Pittsburgh. Because Pittsburgh straddles humid continental and humid subtropical climate zones, it sees warm, humid summers and cold, snowy winters. Although the seasons run through pretty much the whole gamut throughout the year, it rarely sees extreme weather conditions outside of the occasional blizzard during the winter. Because of the variation between (and, in the fall especially, during) the seasons, it's best to watch conditions closely as you pack your bags.
Making a difference in a child or adolescent’s life is not always easy, but the staff of the Mental Health Forensic Services Division at The Harris Center strives to do just that every day. Through a variety of programs, children and adolescents who are involved in the juvenile justice system in Harris County receive treatment and services that address some of the root causes that led them there in the first place. Recovery: one word with countless possibilities. Because there is not one definition of recovery, everyone has their own meaning and their own story. “The Agency slogan is Transforming Lives, and so, when we think of that and we think of recovery, it means to help someone progress in finding meaning in their life. They are not merely progressing towards eliminating symptoms, but to be able to live a meaningful life past the mental health challenges that they face,” said Ana Oyarvide, Recovery Manager for the Mental Health Outpatient Services Division of The Harris Center. While the recovery journey is unique for each individual, it is a tie that binds. Those who have lived experience in recovery from mental illness, commonly referred to as peers, offer an insight that is invaluable to those who are either just starting their process or those who find it beneficial to talk to others who understand what it is like to live with a mental illness.
I was born in Pereira, Colombia, and raised in Los Angeles, California. What to you aspire to accomplish in the future? I am currently studying Finance at Menlo College with that, my goal is to focus in the industry of Import and Exporting. Throughout my life, I have been a part of numerous projects that deal with international business and communications which has opened my interest towards this industry. With time and experience I would then like to become a broker and open my own Import and export company. I heard about Manos Accelerator from past Manos Interns and Menlo College Alumni. Because of their great experiences, I became interested in the opportunity and personally reached out to Sylvia. Sylvia informed me of the business and the positive impact that Manos has on the Latin community and offered me the opportunity in being a Manos Accelerator Intern. Because I have the privilege of being bilingual, I have had the opportunity with staying in contact with multiple startups from various parts of Latin America. My role at Manos Accelerator was requirement manager for future startups to participate in the in-depth Manos Accelerator program. With Sylvia as my mentor, I expanded my ability to communicate with individuals from different countries and further the Manos Accelerator Network. The main attributes that I have noticed in myself that have grown from my experience at Manos is being able to/how to communicate with individuals from different countries and cultures. In the professional business environment, I have learned to listen and allow myself to be guided by Mentors, Angel Investors, and future business leaders from the Latin Community. Outside of growing professionally, personally I have learned how to conduct myself in an office environment and withstand the fast pace workforce. If your second guessing yourself, just simply ask. As a new intern, I was able to learn about the terms and procedures that it takes to run a successful company and grow its cliental. The overall environment at Manos was very helpful and it taught me how to get important tasks done in a timely matter. I feel comfortable walking in to a new company getting to know everyone one and getting the job done. I have been able to improve my communication and writing skills in Spanish itself while learning the ins and outs of different Latin American cultures. My confidence as future business leader has risen and my ability to apply my skills has improved. One of the major experiences I received being an Intern at Manos was working with the various number of startups, mentors, and angel investors around the world. The fact that I would walk in on a Monday and have a conference call with a startup from Colombia and an hour later have another conference call with a startup from Uruguay was excellent. Another key experience was being able to attend multiple events around the bay area and expand my own personal network. Share a memorable experience at Manos? It’s hard to choose, but one of my most memorable moments was when my co-workers and I decided to all go out to a San Jose Earthquakes match. That allowed us to truly get to know each other as individuals and not only as co-workers. I become more confident with my Spanish and sales techniques. This internship was not only fun, but humbling in the way that I was able to learn from so many bright minds. I really enjoyed working with so many different personalities and experts. I was able to learn and apply my skills throughout different projects and I absolutely loved being able to attend so many events. My relationship with Sylvia was amazing. She helped me throughout different occasions and she was also very welcoming. Although there was that separation of Boss and employee, she made me feel very comfortable and at home. My relationship with the startups was outstanding. Because I am Latino, I was able to connect with them and create new relationships. Where are you now? What are you doing now? Currently I am finishing my last year at Menlo College, and planning on going overseas and furthering my knowledge in the industry of Importing and Exporting.

The Alkal-Life Water System is an advanced purification ionizer that plays a vital role in our health and provides for us a better way to apply the use of water in our everyday lives. In order to maximize the benefits, the system uses a high performance active carbon filter that removes microscopic organisms and water clustering. The tourmaline enclosed in the filter also plays a crucial role in sieving out contaminants to deliver pristine water. Over time, however, mineral buildup and chlorine residuals may clog the channel. As a result, the water pressure may increase causing internal damages and malfunctions to the water system. We recommended the filter be replaced after the cycle of use of 792 gallons, or 3,000 liters (6 months’ worth of purified water). The Filter Discount Program is designed to help you save money and also to maximize and maintain the performance of the Alkal-Life Water System. This agreement is on 6 filters given at every 6-month interval throughout a 3 year term. On enrollment to this 3-year program, Richway International will ship to you one filter replacement for every 6 months (total of 6 filters). Under the filter discount program, each filter costs you just $100 including shipping. You must sign up for the program and your credit card will be billed before each filter is shipped. Normally the filters cost $120 each plus $15 shipping. We also recommend purchasing our CLEANING FILTER to be used before every filter change. These filters insure that your Alkal-Life is clean and safe when every new filter is installed. Cleaning filters cost $50 plus shipping. People with well water must also purchase our “S” Filter which pre-filters your tap water before it reaches the Alkal-Life unit and filter. This is a comprehensive filter that removes typical contaminants found in well water such as heavy iron. The “S” filter is good for 10,000 gallons of use and cost $240 plus shipping.

When about-to-be parents rush to the hospital for delivery full of the joy and terror, there is almost never the thought that when they leave their newborn will not be with them. They're unprepared for the heartbreak of an empty lap. But an infant born too sick or too soon to go home may remain behind in the neonatal intensive care unit for a few days or for months on end. This week, for example, Kamryn Ruth Abbott celebrated her third month of life at Memorial Hermann Memorial City Medical Center's NICU.
The Deer Creek Trail is, without a doubt, not the best trail in Maryland. It’s probably not even the best in Susquehanna State Park. But there is at least something soothing about the surroundings on this largely wooded loop hike, situated just off the Susquehanna River in northeast Maryland. Here lofty trees, many devoid of branches, rise like sentinels above the damp, cool earth. The tranquil Susquehanna, though not visible, sets the stage for an abundance of bird and animal life, while the trail’s namesake creek carves steep hillsides, funneling rain water into the rushing stream. Amid the serene landscape is a surprising, hidden gem: an award-winning American beech tree, a woody behemoth with thick tentacles that is sure to foster the imagination. Susquehanna State Park is relatively convenient for passersby on Interstate 95, situated about halfway between Baltimore, Maryland and Wilmington, Delaware. (Note: Take Exit 89 to Havre de Grace/Churchville.) A number of country roads converge on the park, but it is Rock Run Road that cuts through the heart of the preserve, weaving through open fields before plunging into a sea of trees, darkened by the thick canopy. At the banks of the Susquehanna—and the end of Rock Run Road—turn left onto Stafford Road and continue northwest for 1.5 miles. Take a left again at the entrance to the Deer Creek Picnic Area; this is only one of many possible starting points for the Deer Creek Trail loop, but it is probably the most easily accessible. At around the hike’s highest point, the trail forks again, with a short spur heading right to the base of a gargantuan white oak tree, while the main path—now a narrow single-track—continues straight. From here, the trail tracks downhill into a ravine that feeds the Elbow Branch of Deer Creek. Stay right at the two forks—a pair of faint spurs provide access to the campground at 0.77 miles and 0.81 miles. Cutting sharply right, the trail descends in force, eventually crossing a small wooden bridge at 9/10 miles. What goes down must come up, and the Deer Creek Trail from here begins a sequence in which it climbs in and out of several small gullies. By 1.2 miles, the path has almost doubled back on itself, but then quickly cuts northwest and begins its sharpest descent yet. Around 1.25 miles from the start, the Deer Creek Trail flanks its main attraction on the left: the award-winning American beech tree. This hulking mass was a “Maryland Big Tree Champion,” meaning it was—at one point—the largest recorded tree of its species. Alas, it appears the beech has been bested in recent years, as other records list four other American beeches in Maryland as larger. In any case, the massive tree, which boasts dozens of robust branches, is an impressive sight. Beyond the beech, the Deer Creek Trail continues on its sharp declivity, finally abating at around 1.4 miles. Here the path rounds a right-hand bend and passes a spur that leads down to the Deer Creek Pumping Station, visible downhill to the left. It is around this point that the trail’s namesake stream also comes into view—though at a distance and obscured by the tree cover. Heading northeast, the trail drops to clear a ravine then begins a steady climb, reaching nearly the top of a woody knoll before it descends again. Look for the remains of a short rock wall on the left at around 1.8 miles, a testament to the early settlers of the Susquehanna River area. At two miles, the path forks again (stay right), marking the start of the homestretch. Continue ¼ mile—staying right again at the next fork—to continue to the end of the circuit, arriving at the original four-way junction after about an hour to 1 ½ hours of hiking. Bear left and return to the parking lot. This entry was posted in Maryland, Susquehanna State Park and tagged beech, Deer Creek, Deer Creek Trail, loop hike, Maryland, Susquehanna State Park.

If you’ve often envied French-girl style but found it hard to actually keep up with (let alone emulate), you’re not alone. I, too, have always been enamored by the elusive je ne sais quoi of the Parisian style setter yet have never quite been able to figure out how to make it my own. Enter: the solution to that problem, an Instagram handle by the name of @parisianvibe. As you may be able to guess, the account culls imagery from stylish French girls across the web and shares them daily. Not only is it a great addition to your feed (with shots of , Camille Charrière, and more), but it will also introduce you to the accounts of girls you may have otherwise missed. What else to expect from the account? Of course, some @oldceline, an interestingly extensive amount of the color brown (trending, maybe?) and, of course, overall outfit inspiration you’ll want to re-create ASAP. They even, on occasion, help you ID exact items in the photos by tagging brands. What more could you ask for?! To see some of my favorite recent posts from the account and, of course, shop the key pieces in each look, just simply continue on below. Up next? The fall outfit I’m already seeing all over NYC.

Do you know about eye care? When was your last eye examination? If it has been ages since you’ve had an appointment, you need to read the tips below. For best results, see a highly qualified eye doctor for serious issues with your eyes to get the best care. To locate the top doctors, look to your friends and family for suggestions, as well as find feedback from patients online. Doing this will ensure that your eyes are always getting the greatest care around. Shades can provide excellent daytime eye protection. Get a good pair with great UV protection, and wear them each time you leave the house. Sun damages both the eyes and the skin surrounding the eyes. Do not go without eye protection on sunny days. You may already know you need to wear sunglasses in the summertime, but you should realize they are important in winter, too. This is because snow reflects a great deal of light. UV rays from the sun can still hurt your eyes on cloudy days, even though it is not bright. Not all sunglasses work the same. Make sure the sunglasses you use are able to block close to 100% of the UVB and UVA rays. Some poorly-made sunglasses may actually hurt your vision. Do you still smoke? It is time to quit. You probably know about the damage it does to your lungs, but you may not know your eyes are affected, too. Most smokers have an increased proclivity for eye disease. Damage and harmful growth of cataract are minimized when you quit. A major way to protect the eyes is by wearing sunglasses. Even on cloudy days you should protect your eyes from harmful UV rays. Find shades that offer UV protection. It may be worth paying more to ensure that your eyes are protected. Those who are constantly staring at a computer screen should be aware that doing so may damage eyes. Blink often to prevent dryness. Try not to stare at your screen too often. You can also invest in a special, anti-glare screen. Finally, position the monitor so that your eyes are even with the top edge of the screen. Look down at your computer at all times. Poor eye health is usually from many different factors. It is highly important to know what it takes to ensure healthy eye care. Now that you’ve read this, you should know what it takes to keep your eyes healthy.
Wash your tatties and cut into orange segments. Do not peel them as the skin is full of nutritious goodness. Put them in a bowl and slather them with dark soy sauce. Leave them for a while, stirring occasionally. Place them on a baking tray, skin down, with shallots and garlic cloves - they need a bit of olive oil. Roast until they are nicely cooked. They will be brown and crisp with fluffy interiors - a bit like me.
Balsamic vinegar from Nemea grapes aged 3 years in French oak barrels with natural concentrated carob juice. Chocolaty flavor in a rich and acidic body with a slight bitter undertone. Acidity 6%. No sulfites added. No preservatives. No coloring. No added flavoring. I had never tried carob balsamic before. This was the first bottle that I bought. I have bought other products from this company all of which, have exceeded my expectations. Carob has a slightly bitter aftertaste which means you have to like bitter to like this vinegar. My wife loves it but I will switching back to good old grape balsamic again.

Last Friday’s nonfarm payrolls report of 215,000 new jobs in July with its attendant announcement of an unemployment rate of 5.3 percent drew mostly yawns from the media. That wasn’t the case on February 3 of this year when Jim Clifton, CEO of the polling company, Gallup, wrote a stunning opinion piece on the company’s web site calling the U.S. unemployment rate “The Big Lie.” Clifton raised more media frenzy the next day when he appeared on CNBC and suggested he might “disappear” for questioning the government’s unemployment rate. Back then, the official unemployment rate was 5.6 percent. Today it’s 5.3 percent – a very healthy looking rate for an economy that is supposedly on the rebound. Even for a government hell bent on putting the best possible spin on overcoming the Wall Street train wreck of 2008, which brought on the worst economic slump since the Great Depression, characterizing someone working one hour a week in a lawn job as “employed” seems like the height of duplicity. We decided to check it out. We went directly to the source: the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the Federal agency that calculates who is employed and who is not. According to the BLS, the bogus nature of who is counted as “employed,” is even worse than Clifton suggests. Not only is a person counted as employed if they are working one hour a week in a lawn job paying $20, but a worker who makes no money at all donating his or her services to a family business for 15 hours or more per week is also considered employed. Throughout the rest of America, one’s donation of services typically defines one as a volunteer not an employed worker; but the BLS doesn’t see it that way. “Garrett is 16 years old, and he has no job from which he receives any pay or profit. However, Garrett does help with the regular chores around his parents’ farm and spends about 20 hours each week doing so. “Lisa spends most of her time taking care of her home and children, but she helps in her husband’s computer software business all day Friday and Saturday. The tricked up unemployment rate helps explain why the labor force participation rate is at a 38-year low of 62.6 percent. According to the BLS, July 2015 seasonally adjusted data show 93,770,000 individuals not in the labor force. That compares with 91,975,000 not in the labor force in July 2014. How can the economy and unemployment situation be improving when droves of workers are dropping out of the labor pool? Blaming the anomaly on retiring baby boomers does not explain what is happening to working age men and women. In July 2014, there were 35.5 million men aged 16 and older not in the labor force. Today, that figure stands at 37.5 million not in the labor force, an increase of exactly 2 million men of working age. For women aged 16 and older, in the same span of time, their nonparticipation in the labor force has grown from 54.9 million individuals to 56.2 million. The dismal labor force participation statistics are completely consistent with a tepid economy that can’t get out of the mire of 2 percent annual GDP growth, negligible wage growth, extended periods of unemployment (28 weeks versus the typical 16 weeks in the two decades prior to the 2008 crash), sluggish consumer demand, collapsing commodity prices and persistent warnings of the threat of global deflation. Update: Labor force participation data for July 2014 has been updated to reflect the seasonally adjusted number.

Dr Isa Ali Pantami, Director-General of Nigerian Information and Technology Development Agency, NITDA, says Information and Communications Technology, ICT, is a significant contributor to the nation’s Gross Domestic Product, GDP. Mr Pantami made this known during the NOTAP/NITDA Stakeholders’ Roundtable Discussion on the Use of Nigerian Software in the Financial Banking Services Sector. According to him, the GDP stands at 11. 81 per cent as at the third quarter of 2018. Mr Pantami was represented by Chris Okeke, Director, Lagos Zonal office of NITDA. He said that notably, local and foreign investors invested about N38 billion into Nigerian start-ups in the second and third quarters of 2018, of which 75 per cent of the funds went into Nigerian FinTech. “The growth underscored the upward trajectory of ICT as a significant contributor to Nigeria’s GDP, currently at about 11.81 per cent as at the third quarter of 2018,’’ Mr Pantami said. He said that to complement these efforts, government had identified the need for concerted actions and policies to promote local contents as the core pillar of economic diversification. “You may recall that in 2013, NITDA issued the Guidelines for Nigerian Content Development in ICT, essentially mandating agencies of government to compulsorily prioritise indigenous ICTs for procurement where available in-country. “The regulation mandates a compulsory consideration of indigenous hardware, software, networking service, ICT services and data management first before any non-Nigerian service provider. “The policy has resulted in the growth of the purchase of indigenous contents in the public sector. “The year 2018 recorded the highest figures of purchase of indigenously-assembled hardware and software with a total of 355,647 units sold, compared to 154,424 in the previous year. “Implementation of this policy has also ensured that 95 per cent of the Federal Government’s data is hosted locally,’’ Mr Pantami said. He said with the issuance of the Presidential Executive Orders 003 and 005; the Nigerian Content Guidelines of NITDA received a significant boost and had strengthened the arm of the agency in implementing the guidelines. According to the director-general, the IT Project Clearance Process of NITDA has saved the country over N13billion of bogus spending. Mr Pantami noted that the clearance process had ensured that over N5 billion worth of software-related projects would be procured from Nigerian companies from 2018 till date. He said that all these would have been impossible but with the consistent and unwavering support of President Muhammadu Buhari, who had given the agency and the IT industry relentless support to implement far-reaching policies for the development of the country. Mr Pantami also congratulated the financial service industry as led by the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, in granting spaces to young and keen minds to develop products that had continually redefined the Financial Technology Space (FinTech). “The growth of our FinTech market has been in no small measure due to the willingness of financial institutions to become fodder for these adventurists to step up and spin brilliant ideas that have shaped how we pay for services and conduct transactions. “We have come a long way and we are proud of these achievements occasioned largely by the ICT and the financial sectors working together. He, however, assured that all necessary solution reached at the Roundtable discussion would be relayed to the president with utmost urgency. The News Agency of Nigeria reports that the theme of the two-day roundtable was: “Adoption and Development of Local Content Technology as Growth Drivers for the Nigerian Economy’’.
Thursday, Dec. 22, 2005 dawned cold and clear as I headed up to the Pecos River high bridge launch site for my paddle to Seminole Canyon and Seminole Cave. I had been planning this for a long time and was really looking forward to seeing the caves again. I launched at 9:02 and headed down the Pecos to the confluence of the Rio Grande, then headed left down the river. Amistad Lake has backed up both rivers so there isnt any flow, just flat water and high canyon walls. I had the river to myself this morning except for some goats high up the canyon wall in a cave and a pair of hawks circling above. The river was calm and clear until I turned the corner and entered the Rio Grande. Here the wind picked up a little and made the first couple of miles pretty chilly as I was in the shade from the high cliffs on the Texas side. However, by 10:30 I was able to shuck the fleece and enjoy the sunshine and warmth. Several miles downriver I was surprised to see a large power line going across into Mexico, but soon saw there were several large houses there. Around the bend I saw a couple of houses on the Texas side. I remember a Mexican rancher tried for years in the 70s to get a line run from the US side, and I guess he finally did. I dont know who owns the houses, but they would make a nice place to stay as they are on a small side canyon. The Texas side of the river is prettier with its many caves and erosion features. The Mexican side is shorter and has no caves at all-both sides are the same rock, so I dont know why. The caves arent caused by river erosion as they are too high above the old river bed-the Mexican side being lower would mean the river would have had to be several miles wide to carve the caves that high up. You can see evidence in many of them of water seeping out leaving stains so I imagine this is how they were formed. Its amazing how much a little seepage can erode the soft limestone pockets (there isnt enough rain to help speed the process)-many of these caves are as big as houses. There are a few that can be accessed by boat and will be explored on another trip. The cliffs are so steep and the original river so far below that few have been inhabited or used as rock shelters. They would still be interesting to explore and take photos from. About a mile down from the confluence of the rivers is Parida Cave on the Texas side. There is a boat dock there and you can access the small kayak landing on the left of the big rock on the left of the ramp. As I had explored this on a previous trip, I didnt even stop. There is a wonderful canyon on the Mexican side of the river that is well worth exploring for its beautiful high walls and incredible erosion features-many look like works of art. There are a couple of canyons on the Mexican side that will require further exploration and two short ones on the Texas side that I did explore and found some interesting caves in them. One would make a great hike out of the canyon and offer a wonderful view of the river. The cave, Pink Cave, would be fun to explore and supposedly has some paintings in it. Since it doesnt have a landing and the water was cold, I didnt get out of the boat to explore it this time. In warmer weather this would be easy to do. Many of the caves that are accessible and would be fun to explore require getting out of the boat and getting wet up to your waist as you scramble up the rock piles. Seminole Cave is one of the best examples of cave art in the US as it is in a large under hang and the dry weather has protected them for thousands of years. There are dozens of paintings along the wall with the Panther being the most famous. The park service has a nice boat dock here as this is the only way to access the paintings-there is no trail to the cave. The cave is fenced off to protect from vandalism, but the mesh is large enough to take photos through and there are several signs explaining the paintings and some history. I remember growing up in Del Rio we used to go up and touch the paintings - this was way before we knew we werent supposed to! It is difficult but not impossible for a kayak to land here. There are two places on either side of the dock where you could get out into the water and then climb up the rock. Since it was still cold and didnt want to get wet, I got under the docks ramp and used it to pull myself up out of my boat onto the steps that go down into the water. That wasnt a pretty site and Im glad no one else was there at the time! Getting back in was a lot easier. After eating lunch, I headed up Seminole Canyon to see if there are any places to camp and found a great place where the water ends. It gets real shallow at a wide flat spot and there is plenty of camping room as well as the canyon to explore. If one could camp here, this trip would be an easy overnighter and allow plenty of time to explore the canyons on the Mexican. As it is, it is a long day trip-it took me 11 minutes shy of 7 hours to complete the 19 mile round trip with a hour stop for lunch at Seminole Cave. I averaged 3.9 mph and was feeling the fast pace by the end of the day. Exploring the side canyons and some of the caves would add a couple more hours to the trip, so spending the night in Seminole Canyon would really make the trip more pleasurable. This is a wonderful and beautiful trip and well worth the effort because of the scenery and the cave paintings. There is plenty of parking at the put-in along with a potty. Theres an incredible view at the put-in of the high bridge and the high canyons. There isnt a potty at Seminole Cave however there are some places to get out of the kayak and answer the call. I will be doing this trip again Memorial Weekend and hope to explore the side canyons. no, unless you are fishihng. The Mexican game wardens are getting strict about fishing w/o a Mexican fishing license.

"It isn′t easy being a pioneer in the state of Washington in 1899, but it′s particularly hard when you are the only girl ever born in the new settlement. With seven older brothers and a love of adventure, May Amelia Jackson just can′t seem to abide her family′s insistence that she behave like a Proper Young Lady. She′s sure she could do better if only there were at least one other girl living along the banks of the Nasel River. And now that Mama′s going to have a baby, maybe there′s hope. Inspired by the diaries of her great-aunt, the real May Amelia, first-time novelist Jennifer Holm has given us a beautifully crafted tale of one young girl whose unique spirit captures the courage, humour, passion and depth of the American pioneer experience."
Well being, wellness, it’s the sense of health itself that adds value to what we call life. Our diet gets a particular boost in terms of our relationship with the above. Considering that the Mediterranean diet is the most proven form of diet approved for physical and mental health, the important role of olive oil as a healthy choice in our daily lives, is plain obvious. The secret of the tree of life as we call the olive tree, is that it can make our lives better. Our ancestors used it successfully and we as their heirs are here to tell you the authentic story. The Extra Virgin Olive Oil is the most important part of the Greek gastronomy, which occupies a prominent place in our culture. A healthy choice. Olive oil uses are manifold, but the basic and most appropriate use is in its raw form. It is often seen in salads and soups that we find in Greek gastronomy. It is the healthiest fat on the planet. It is rich in monounsaturated fats and powerful antioxidants that contribute to heart health. The people who eat olive oil have a much lower risk for heart attacks and strokes, according to scientific studies. Of course, in the Greek gastronomy olive oil exists in other forms. If you want to explore the tastes of Greek cuisine, sign up to our Paradosie Newsletter and keep an eye for future posts on Greek cooking.

On Thursday 4 April, Rt Hon Clare Perry MP published an open letter to all heat network operators regarding Heat Trust, a voluntary industry scheme to raise consumer protection standards. Energy Minister Claire Perry has written an open letter encouraging all heat network operators to join the voluntary Heat Trust scheme, in order to raise consumer protection standards ahead of legislation being introduced. This follows a Westminster Hall Debate on 19 February 2019. The ADE published a briefing for members that is available here. I encourage all owners and operators of heat networks who are not currently registered with Heat Trust and who do not offer equivalent standards to consider joining. The quality standards that the voluntary scheme sets out will give your consumers important reassurance and protections. Heat Networks are vital to ensuring a cost effective move to a low carbon Britain. Putting customers at the heart of these networks is key and that's why clear independent standards are needed. It is excellent to see the Minister for Energy and Clean Growth, Claire Perry MP, calling for networks to join Heat Trust. Heat networks need to work for customers, and at Heat Trust we have been working to promote better customer service practices in the heat network sector since 2015. The standards we set are designed to ensure customers benefit from a level of service and protection that is comparable to the rest of the energy market. We support the call for regulation, but proactive action is needed now. We welcome the Minister’s letter encouraging all heat networks to join Heat Trust. With over three years’ experience, Heat Trust can support the market to ensure heat suppliers are equipped and prepared for future regulation. We also recognise that as the market evolves, so too should our standards. We are keen to work and engage with all types of suppliers to understand their needs and help inform future development of the scheme. BEIS noted that if operators have difficulties meeting Heat Trust standards they should contact BEIS setting out the nature of their concerns: please email heatnetworks@beis.gov.uk. The Heat Trust press release can be read here.

Actress Ellen Pompeo of “Grey’s Anatomy” has sold an income property in the Hollywood Hills for $2.075 million, or $80,000 more than the asking price. The split-level residence on a leafy hillside lot had been leased out in the $6,500 to $7,500 per month range. It previously changed hands nearly a decade ago for $1.226 million, records show. Set at the end of a steep driveway, the Harry Greene-designed house boasts walls of windows that capture treetop and canyon views. About 1,900 square feet of open-plan living space include a step-down living room, a media room and an eat-in kitchen. In the master suite, sliding glass doors open to a private outdoor bathtub. There are three bedroom and two bathrooms in all. Outdoors, a central courtyard holds a rock fire pit and built-in barbecue. Flagstone and lush landscaping surround the swimming pool and spa in the backyard. Brett Lawyer of Hilton & Hyland was the listing agent. Tori Horowitz of Compass represented the buyer. Pompeo, 48, is known for her long-running role as Dr. Meredith Grey on the medical drama show. Among her film credits are “Catch Me If You Can” (2002), “Old School” (2003) and “Life of the Party” (2005).

What is the difference between ‘simulate’ and ‘imitate’? Thank you. Scientists used the new software to simulate how urban commuters travel in the city. This robot is designed to simulate real human emotions, like excitement, sadness, and anger. This immersive VR game simulates the experience of being under the sea. Some of us might think that parrots can speak – but what they are really doing is just imitating human speech. If you want to be a successful artist, you need to stop imitating other musicians and find your own style. Everyone laughed when the kid tried to mimic a dinosaur.

Only today don’t be angry. Only today count your blessings. Only today be kind to everyone around you. Eat the food of gratitude. Honour your parents and those near you. The Virtues, indestructible foundations of the "Project Mikado Nintoku" To dig into the ancient and profound Taumaturgiche roots of the "Project Mikado Nintoku" , it is necessary to sit comfortable while you listen to my new story. We have seen at the beginning of the story of the birth of Japan, how the “Taumaturgiche virtue of burns” represent a command on the emotions and mental state, and the “intestinal worms or ossurasi” represent the command on the physical state, and of “the equilibrium” the fusion between the buio-Kury-ama with the light-Fuji.These three virtues are the Taumaturgiche foundation of the "Project Mikado Nintoku" .That in honour of the wise one Yuzu Asaf and of Mikado Nintoku-tennò is transmitted Christmas Eve at midnight . Let’s continue and try to absorb the first life lived in Japan by an official Makado, that with spiritual courage transmitted to a simple land worker Sensei called Kami a part of the divine power known later as "Project Mikado Nintoku" , that is the gift to absorb Light and Stars with the aim to increase the path of life on earth. The "Project Mikado Nintoku" began his first official path in 107a.d. and his real founder was not called Mikado Usui, but Yuzu Asaf, that at the age of 107 years went for the second time to Japan and gave the ability to absorb the “light and the stars” to a young boy of 20 years called Nintoku-tennò. Now sit comfortably and I will tell you of his enlightened story. Many years ago there was in the sunny land of Japan, an Emperor by the name of Nintoku-tennò who left a profound mark on that era. Now I will transmit the immortal story that is shown to me with my inner eye. I see my Sacred Book in front of me and I am ready to begin. “Dear Mikado Francesco when you read this page it will be the sign that humanity has arrived at the third millennium and brother will fight brother each in the name of his God*. Mikado are you asking yourself why. The answer is one only, because Japan has closed the door of the 7th. Heaven and lives intensely in the power of the third dimension, without a Sensei, a Divinity, a Mikado of Light and Stars! *Israel and Palestine, America, Pakistan, Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, Corea, Japan, India and Kashmir. ***it should happen by the end of the cycle of purification 2000-14. After a moment of repose I am now ready to take up my story again thinking of my experience of the light and the stars lived at the peak of Fuji and I want to disclose to you something that has accompanied me all my enlightened lives. The love for my Sacred Mountain of Fuji. In the year 314, word spread that Fuji was the residence of immortals, hence the Chinese doctor of the Emperor of China Hsu Fuh, Ts’ in Che Houang and the magic Taoist, went to Japan in search of immortality. The historian Sseu ma Ts-ien affirms that he arrived with three thousand young people all skilled in various trades and with many sacks of seeds. The magic liquor was not found and the wise man refused to let the young people return to China. In so doing many classic books were destroyed as the the Chinese Emperor had them destroyed in revenge for not receiving the much awaited elixir. His many companions formed a rural family community in Kawachi and from then on forgot the Emperor and his orders and lived happily ever after. It is well to remember that Fuji will show all the strength of her anger by letting an entire town on a mount on her western side fall into degradation of body and soul. * This has been the inspirational source of many poets and painters. It is written in the Sacred Book that when the Emperor of Japan Nintoku was born, an enormous white cloud formed over the crater of Fuji and dispersed in all directions sending all over the country waves of violet energy. Nintoku was born with a very particular sign. On the top part of his arm there were three suns or vaioli in a vertical line a cross that visibly came out of the flesh and at the centre of this there appeared a face with a crown of thorns. On precisely 18th.october a.d. at 8.30. the moment when he was born, a bad omen, the owl Tsuko flew into his room. The father, the Emperor of Ojin-tennò secretly venerated as the God of war with the name of Hachiman, to change the future of his son, gave his son the name of O-sasagi and his other son the name of Tsuki. He wanted his first born Waki-iratsuko to succeed the throne but to guide the land of The Rising Sun was too great a responsibility for this son, so he asked his brother to accept this honour in his place. O-sasagi refused the crown bowing to his father’s will and in consequence a competition of modesty between the two brothers lasted for more than three years ending with the suicide of Waki-iratsuko. After this tragic gesture O-sasagi was morally compelled to help the weak in spirit and become Mikado Nintoku-tennò the new Emperor of Japan. Now we will share together a beautiful ancient story set in the land of The Rising Sun. The two principal protagonists are two children born at exactly the same year, same day same second. It is important to know that on that very day the sun and the full moon fused together to give a strange vibration of divine and Taumaturgic* energy to chosen spirits. In this light that was settling on the earth there were two who decided to be part of the sacred country of The Rising Sun and these were Alfa and Omega or the beginning and the end of the path. One was called Kami, the son of a land worker and the other Nintoku, son of the Emperor of Japan Ojin-tennò. The story tells us that both from the moment of birth cured the sick with their hands from which passed a strange flow of energy that they felt coming from their heart. Many moons passed and both Kami and Nintoku became respected and adored by all. Kami loved the land and the so called “cure of the earth or sacred virtue” this love had been in his family for many generations and knew that now his elderly grandfather was awaiting his natural passage in nature. For Nintoku it was completely different he had absorbed from birth “the rare Taumaturgic or Mikado power” to cure the body and soul of the Japanese people. The years passed and the day arrived of Kami’s 33th. birthday Celebrating with his family in front of the warm fire his elderly grandfather asked him what he would like for this special day. Kami paused for a moment and then surprised his parents with a strange request. He would like to go away from the family home for 21 days. They of course asked him the reason for this unusual desire, and his only answer was that they must try to understand what was happening to him bodily and spiritually, and ensured them that he would return having enhanced the family honour. The next day Kami said goodbye to the family and the father gave him his blessing and watched as he walked away from the house, his figure fading into the distance enveloped in a ray of sun that the god Amaterasu sent to accompany him on his journey. After 22 days the old parents very worried, watched anxiously for the return of their beloved son. After some time they saw his figure in the distance and with great joy they and every one in the village celebrated his long awaited return. To add to the dilemma the young Emperor Nintoku-tennò had also disappeared in the same strange way at exactly the same time as Kami the kind peasant. The birth of the "Project Mikado Nintoku" One evening after a long day on the land Kami was returning home with his old grandfather when he felt the warm rays of the sun sent by Aamaterasu enter his heart and burn it with love. In the prescence of his father his body was completely enveloped in light and all the ground around him was so absorbed in energy that all the planted seeds gave immediate life to plants. “Peace to you my loved ones, the moment has come for me to tell you of the “sacred dream” lived by me in those 21 days of my absense. Close your eyes and listen to me with your hearts open because now we can all share together this beautiful dream that you will want to keep all the life. Imagine that in this dream you have taken the decision to go out of your Kury-ama, that represents the anticamera of the light, to understand “who you are” really and to do this you must walk to the top of the sacred Fuji where there is the light. One warm morning you decide it is the moment to say goodbye to your family and go towards the light. On the way you hear the song of the birds, you feel the sweet wind blowing from the top of Fuji and the sound of the source of the river that transports it’s sacred water all over Japan. Walking towards the river looking at the peak of Fuji at a certain moment you see a figure in a regal pose meditating. Above his head there is a beautiful light unknown to man. You try not to disturb Him but He is aware of your presence and opens his eyes. They are full of love and he gives a beautiful smile. You lower your head in respect before asking how He radiates that magnificent light and if it is possible to show you how. He answers that a long long time in the past he asked his master the same question. “I was 21 years old when I decided to come out from my Kury-ama to go to Fuji to make a big decision in communion with the sacred Divinity. I stopped exactly in this spot of the river and saw a man with long hair dressed in a long white linen robe with strange signs on His hands and feet. He said He had come from afar and was called Yuzu Asaf. He was completely enveloped in a incandescent light and His every movement was so peaceful and harmonious that it did not belong to this world. Yuzu Asaf became my master and in answer to my question He looked at me with an indescribable love, opened His chest and pulled out His heart from where came a flame, He then opened my chest and took out my heart and put in the flame. When He returned my heart I immediately felt an intense love, that of Yuzu Asaf that He had passed to me through the flame. This love was in honour of the energy that the Only Father or God had left on Fuji, in the name of "Project Mikado Nintoku" . That flame became an enormous fire, but a fire that doesn’t burn, but purifies all that it touches.It touched every cell in my body and transformed my love. The love grew and grew. That fire touched all my emotions and became so intense that I felt to be the spokesman for the world. In the name of all humanity I thank the human body. All it’s functions that contribute to life: the blood the bones, the fluids, the nerves, the muscles, the intestines, and all the cells that form them. at perfect peace in the world. because it is the sacred temple of God. The fire continues to burn and I feel the need to share this love. I decide to insert this “Divine Flame” into the centre of the earth and so make my way to Fuji. that preside on the earth, earth I thank you. generosity that gives life to all forms of life. *In the past they were known as a Divinity or Kami. My love grows even more looking at the sparks in the sea that are given by the “Sacred Flame” and watch as the flame becomes one with the sea. I thank all the angels that preside in the sea. Sea I thank you that we may live. of man that does not recognize you. that beat on the coast and destry the ships. My love does not stop it grows and grows. The “Sacred Flame” is put in every flower every blade of grass, and every plant bewitching the path of Kury-ama that leads to the peak of Sacred Fuji and receives in exchange the love and all becomes one only. I thank the angels that preside in vegetation. Grass, trees, plants of all variety I thank you. Thanks to your immense generousity we live. of man that does not acknowledge you. I put the “Divine Flame” in every crystal every stone in every speck of dust from the lava of Fuji, in the metals and all love me and become one. I thank the angels that preside in the minerals. of minerals I thank you. Every day we live thanks to you. and pardon the irresponsibility of man. The “Sacred Fire” grows and purifies all that it touches I decide to put it in food and it becomes one. I thank the angels that preside in the food. Thanks to all types of food. Because of you we live. Pardon man’s lack of gratitude and greed. You are the souce of our energy to live and work. The fire caused by the “Sacred Flame” continues to burn and it can’t be contained inside I must share this great love with the water and be at one with it. I thank the angels that reside in the water. I thank you water, without you we do not live. We thank you for your existence and for your function. I decide to give the “Sacred Flame” to all the atmospheric phenomena. I feel a communion with thunder lightning storms and tempests and my love grows. I thank the angels that reside in the atmosphere. other celestial phenomena I thank you. Every day our lives depend on you. us for the insolence of man in not acknowledging you. The “Sacred Flame” becomes a great fire the fire that does not burn but purifies.I look at the sky and my love continues to grow for the God Amaterasu. I give thanks to all the angels that preside in the sun. We live every second thanks to your energy. Every living thing owes it’s life to you. We thank you for your generousity. I look at the sky and the “Sacred Flame” wrapped in my love I put in the moon and my love grows. I give thanks to the angels who preside in the moon. we thank you moon for your generousity. My love grows even more and I decide to give the “Sacred Flame” to all the animals of the world that reply with an exchange of love and we become one. on earth as we are and because of some of you we live . We thank you for your part in the equilibrium of nature. Please pardon the insolence of the humans who do not respect your important role on this earth. The fire continues to burn and I realize I am almost at the peak of Fuji, I then feel the need to ask the permission to ask the Divine Residents to share the “Sacred Flame” and my heart with them and become one. awakening with eruptions and land slides. 1.

When board meetings consistently last longer than planned, it indicates that there is more work for the board than it has time for. One way to help the board is to expand it without adding members. The other is to develop more leaders. When a nonprofit is struggling, visualizing the path forward is the first step toward sustainability. In many cases, it is the hardest step.
Is borrower required to pay? DEAR BENNY: We are in the final steps of completing a refinance of our barely year-old $410,000 mortgage. We were pleased with the interest-rate drop, and our local bank was generous in dropping many of the so-called "junk fees" associated with a refinance. However, we are being charged $1,007 for title insurance. When I asked our banker about this, the response was basically, "Well, yes, it is a rip-off but there is nothing we can do about it."

The Dallas Stars are the proud team of the Lone Star State, as members of the Pacific Division in the Western Conference. Although the Stars have only played in Dallas for roughly 20 years, it didn’t take them very long to establish themselves as the new sheriffs in the NHL. With a Stanley Cup Championship in only their sixth season of existence and numerous playoff berths along the way, the Stars have certainly lived up to their name. If you want to watch the most exciting hockey in Texas, then the Stars are your best bet, so purchase your Dallas Stars tickets today! Before the Stars became Dallas residents, the franchise was originated in Minnesota as the North Stars in 1967 as one of six new expansion teams in the NHL. After spending 26 years in Minnesota, the franchise was relocated to Dallas, adopting “Stars” as their team name. With a fresh start in a new city, the Stars wasted no time in making their presence known throughout the NHL, as they advanced to the postseason, sweeping the St. Louis Blues in the first round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs, but eventually ousted by the Vancouver Canucks in the Western Conference Semifinals. The Stars built upon their inaugural season success, and in 1998-1999, Dallas set franchise records by winning 51 regular season games and earning the team’s first President’s Trophy for having the best record in the NHL. Advancing to the Stanley Cup Finals, the Stars went on to defeat the Buffalo Sabres in six games, led by the scoring prowess of Mike Modano and Brett Hull, as well as the stellar goaltending of Ed Belfour, to claim Dallas’ first Stanley Cup Championship. Although the Stars have yet to replicate their 1998-1999 championship season, the Stars have had numerous playoff runs in their ensuing years, and are even more driven to return to the Stanley Cup Playoffs this season. The Stars have assembled a talented roster of young stars in the making like Jamie Benn, as well as big name players like Jaromir Jagr, Ray Whitney, and Derek Roy to help Dallas return as a Western Conference powerhouse.

Chamber choir Voces Musicales was founded in 1999 by Risto Joost mainly from the students of the Estonian Academy of Music.

In April 2001, as a great acknowledgment Voces Musicales won 1st prize in the category of chamber choirs at the international choir competition Tallinn 2001. Success in the Tallinn choir competition was continued by another victory in 2005, when besides two 2nd prizes in minor categories the choir also won the Grand Prix. The repertoire of the choir includes music from Renaissance polyphonies to contemporary compositions. Voces Musicales has been a guest performer at festivals in France, Israel and Finland and has participated in the performance of several oratorical works.

Conductor Risto Joost (b 1980) studied singing as well as choral and orchestral conducting at the Estonian Academy of Music, and received further training at the University for Music and Performing Arts in Vienna. He has participated in the conducting master classes of Neeme Järvi, Esa-Pekka Salonen, Eri Klas, Paul Mägi, Paul Hillier and several early music master classes in Denmark and Sweden. In 1999 Risto Joost founded the chamber choir Voces Musicales. Since 2000, Risto Joost has regularly participated in the Estonian Music Days and NYYD Festival, conducting approximately 50 première performances ranging from chamber music to symphonic repertoire. From 2001–2002, he was a singer in the Estonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir. In 2002, he founded his own orchestra, Ensemble Voces Musicales, which is focused on performing Baroque and contemporary music. In spring 2008 Risto Joost graduated from the Royal College of Music in Stockholm majoring in orchestral conducting with Prof Jorma Panula.

Since Sep 2009, Risto Joost is a conductor at the Estonian National Opera. From 2010–2011 the artistic adviser to Glasperlenspiel Festival. Tallinn Sinfonietta was established with the aim of performing symphonic repertoire written primarily in the 18th and 19th centuries and focusing on music from the classical and romantic periods. The orchestra’s debut concert was titled Mozart and his symphonies; with this concert series the orchestra strives to perform all the symphonies of W A Mozart. Tallinn Sinfonietta consists of young professional musicians who pursue active careers as soloists and chamber musicians, performing in Estonia as well as abroad. Arvo Pärt was born in Estonia on Sep 11th, 1935. His musical studies began in 1954 at the Tallinn Music Secondary School, interrupted less than a year later while he fulfilled his National Service obligation as oboist and drummer in an army band. He returned to school for a year before joining the Estonian Academy of Music in 1957, where his composition teacher was Prof Heino Eller. Pärt started work as a recording engineer with Estonian Radio, wrote music for the stage and received numerous commissions for film scores so that, by the time he graduated from the Academy of Music in 1963, he could already be considered a professional composer. He won 1st prize in the All-Union Young Composers’ Competition for the children’s cantata Our Garden and the oratorio Stride of the World. Living in the USSR, Pärt had little access to what was happening in contemporary Western music but, despite such isolation, the early 60s in Estonia saw many new methods of composition being brought into use and Pärt was at the fore front. His Nekrolog was the first Estonian composition to employ serial technique. He continued with serialism through to the mid 60s in the Symphony No 1, Symphony No 2 and Perpetuum Mobile, but ultimately tired of its rigours and moved on to experiment, in works such as Collage über BACH, with collage techniques. Official judgement of Pärt’s music veered between extremes, with certain works being praised and others, like the Credo of 1968, being banned. This would prove to be the last of his collage pieces and after its composition, Pärt chose to enter the first of several periods of contemplative silence, also using the time to study French and Franco-Flemish choral music from the 14th to 16th centuries: Machaut, Ockeghem, Obrecht, Josquin. At the beginning of the 70s, he wrote a few transitional compositions in the spirit of early European polyphony, like his Symphony No 3. Pärt turned again to self-imposed silence, but re-emerged in 1976 after a transformation so radical as to make his previous music almost unrecognizable as that of the same composer. The technique he invented, or discovered, and to which he has remained loyal, practically without exception, he calls tintinnabuli (‘little bells’), which he describes thus: “I have discovered that it is enough when a single note is beautifully played. This one note, or a silent beat, or a moment of silence, comforts me. I work with very few elements – with one voice, two voices. I build with primitive materials – with the triad, with one specific tonality. The three notes of a triad are like bells and that is why I call it tintinnabulation.” The basic guiding principle behind tintinnabulation of composing two simultaneous voices as one line – one voice moving stepwise from and to a central pitch, first up then down, and the other sounding the notes of the triad – made its first public appearance in the short piano piece Für Alina. Having found his voice, there was a subsequent rush of new works and three of the 1977 pieces – Fratres, Cantus in Memoriam Benjamin Britten, and Tabula Rasa – are still amongst his most highly regarded. As Pärt’s music began to be performed in the west and he continued to struggle against Soviet officialdom, his frustration ultimately forced him, his wife Nora and their two sons, to emigrate in 1980. They never made it to their intended destination of Israel but, with the assistance of his publisher in the West, settled firstly in Vienna. One year later he moved to Berlin. Pärt has concentrated on setting religious texts, which have proved popular with choirs and ensembles around the world. Among his champions in the West have been ECM Records who released the first recordings of Pärt’s music outside the Soviet bloc, Hilliard Ensemble who have premièred several of the vocal works, and Neeme Järvi who conducted the première of Credo in Tallinn in 1968, and has, as well as recording the tintinnabuli pieces, introduced Pärt’s earlier compositions through performances and recordings. Pärt’s achievements were honoured in his 61st year by his election to the American Academy of Arts and Letters. In May 2003, he also received the Contemporary Music Award at the Royal Albert Hall in London, and in May 2011, again in Royal Albert Hall won the Classic BRIT Award Composer of the Year 2011.

The vacation/absent request form must be completed and returned ten business days prior to the desired requested date(s) off.
2013 was the first year Salt Lake City held a Comic Con event. Earlier in the year it started off at a smaller venue but popularity and ticket sales quickly drove the show organizers to migrate to the state’s largest indoor venue the Salt Palace. That wasn’t enough. With over 75,000+ estimated attendees the place was packed. No one minded because it was amazing. It was the single largest geek gathering SLC had ever seen! If you weren’t there in costume you felt out of place. SLC Comic Con 2013 had 100’s of guests… to name a few, Lou Ferrigno, Dwight Schultz, William Shatner, Stan Lee, David Prowse, Peter Mayhew, Dirk Benedict, Ray Park, Weta Workshop, and more. Wesley Productions had the opportunity to exclusively represent ABC Utah (KTVX) and CW30 (KUCW) . Our footage was used on the evening news during the event as well as provided for advertising for future events. It was a blast. Wesley Productions gave ABC and Comic Con ten months to use the footage. Now, in preparation for the 2014 Comic Con, we’re releasing our footage and photos. Enjoy!
Some trendy appearance like black, however you can’t be afraid to do brighter colors like yellow, green, red, etc. To reupholster the chairs, you’ll be able to apply a brand new cloth to coat the chairs in order that they are secured from dirt or different scratch that will injury them. For a straightforward and trendy look, you’ll be able to use a cotton cloth with solid color or symmetrical pattern, whereas for a classic look, solid colored silk or floral patterns can work.

The back of the camera sports a 3-inch1,036k-dot OLED touschreen as well as a 2,359k-dot OLED live viewfinder. It’s magnesium alloy, weather-sealed body make it a mean competitor to the also weather-sealed Olympus O-MD E-M1. "...we’ve found the Panasonic GH4 to balance itself nearly perfectly as a video/still hybrid camera." The GH4 isn’t just a video machine, though. On the stills front it offers solid image quality with nice out-of-camera JPEGs and flexible Raw files. Color and tonality have improved over previous Panasonic models and in-camera Raw processing is a nice addition. Also, the GH4 handles itself reasonably well at higher ISOs. Ergonomically, it offers ample dedicated buttons for things like WB and and ISO, as well as a quick menu accessed via the touchscreen. And while competition is quite fierce at this price point, we’ve found the Panasonic GH4 to balance itself nearly perfectly as a video/still hybrid camera.

One false move meant death when ... They Rode West. Dr. Allen Seward (Robert Francis) is assigned to a western cavalry post where his predecessors had been drunks and slackers. The post doesn't take kindly to him either, especially after he disregards regulations and tends to sick Indians on the malaria-infested reservation. The Indians break away from the reservation to move to a healthier higher ground, and when they join with the Comanches to besiege the fort, Seward is branded as a "woodhawk", the bird that turns against its own. Donna Reed is present as the niece of the post commander; Phil Carey is a cavalry captain that believes the only good Indian is a dead Indian, and May Wynn (who shared a screen debut with Francis in "The Caine Mutiny)is the white girl raised by the Indians and married to the chief's son. Francis would make only two more films before being killed in a 1955 plane crash.

A challenging period during which one struggles to do or cope with something. John went through a rough time after losing both his job and his wife during the same year. I had a rough time repairing the engine because it was so rusty, but I eventually got it running again. n. a hard time; a bad time. I didn’t mean to give you such a rough time. I’m sorry. As with all stocks with connections to the semiconductor sector, A has had a rough time lately.
My husband is famous for two recipes, Ray’s Famous Flap Jacks and Potato Pancakes. He loves to make them and will every weekend if there are any takers or potatoes! If you know our family, you know that hubs loves to buy 50 pound bags of potatoes, you win the prize if you can tell me how many potato pancakes that would make!! Here is the recipe that he likes the best! For perfect results! Peel and grate potatoes, we use a cuisinart grater, Drain off any excess liquid with paper towels. Mix in egg, cream, salt, and black pepper. Add enough flour to make mixture thick. Heat 1/4 inch oil in the bottom of a heavy skillet over medium high heat. Drop two or three 1/4 cup mounds into hot oil, and flatten to make 1/2 inch thick pancakes. Fry, turning once, until golden brown. Transfer to paper towel lined plates to drain, and keep warm in low oven until serving time. Repeat until all potato mixture is used.
Meditation and mindfulness seems like the new buzzword: mindfulness for toddlers, mindfulness in 8 weeks, 3 days to mindful, etc! But mindfulness is actually a really old practice, and I first encountered it more than twenty years ago in the books of Thich Nhat Hanh. Also called Thay by his students, he was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by Martin Luther King, Jr in the 1960’s. He teaches that mindfulness is a practice that you bring everywhere- while you’re walking, doing the dishes, etc, and not only sitting cross-legged on a mat. Relatively new, however, is learning and practicing meditation from an app. Why learn meditation? I recommend a meditation practice to many of my patients, along with talk therapy and sometimes medication if needed. A nice run-down of the research can be found on the American Psychological Association’s website (below), but studies have found that patients have less anxiety, improved stress, get upset less often, and feel more compassionate and empathetic towards others (which, not surprisingly, translates to better relationships). There are also benefits to memory and focus, whch may be why meditation has also been found in studies recently to be helpful for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Another interesting fact: I’m reading Tools of Titans by Tim Ferris right now, where he boils down the wisdom of billionaires, Olympians, etc, and 80% of the people he interviewed have some kind of mindfulness practice! Let me make it clear that NEARLY every app I looked at says it is the “Number one meditation app!” and “found in the pages of…” Using the app store, I looked for the top grossing and downloaded apps. I reviewed five based on this, downloading them onto my iPhone, and practicing with them. Of the apps below, Headspace, Calm, and Omvana have apple Watch support. Headspace (www.headspace.com): app is free, subscription costs about $12.99 per month, but less if you sign up for a year or more. You get 10 free initial sessions with the app. This app had my favorite narrator, Andy Puddicombe, who had a relaxing, approachable voice. Appears to be the app most often used in research studies on using an app for meditation. Has a foundation course with three levels, then series for health,, performance, relationships etc. Cute interface, with mini-monsters. Calm: meditation to relax and focus (www.calm.com): free app, subscription based at $12.99 per month, $59.99 per year. Programs and individual sessions for all skill levels. Lovely, simple interface with nature photos; a daily meditation that changes each day (on Christmas Eve, this was “festivity”), has guided and unguided meditation with nature sounds. You choose your nature sound behind the meditation, and then the meditation occurs over the top of the sound. Could be annoying for some. Friendly sounding narrator- is she smiling while she talks? Unique to this app were sleep stories- basically low key bedtime stories read to you. There are also meditations for kids. Just eight meditations are available with free app without subscription. Meditation studio (www.meditationstudioapp.com): $3.99, 5 star rating on iTunes, ability to schedule your sessions, clean attractive interface. 200 different meditations. No subscription required. Examples: meditation for beginners, happiness, helping your change habits. Multiple different teachers, from different walks of life- meditation teachers, monks, yoga teachers, (Rodney and Colleen Yee, Beryl Bender Birch). Nice: meditations for mom, kids, veterans, first responders. Can superimpose meditation over nature sounds. Stop, Breathe and Think (www.stopbreaththink.org): Free app, but subscription based. $4.99 per month, 10% of revenue goes to a non profit, Tools for Peace to help at risk youth learn mindfulness and meditation. Basic meditations are free. I’ve used this one for a long time, and really like it- it has K.D. Lang music on some of the apps! However, it used to be a free app that you purchased a limited number of meditations available, but has recently switched to the subscription model. Even with the meditations I purchased in the past, there are less than in the Meditation Studio app. Omvana: (www.omvana.com): app free, meditations are charged per series or class. Store is iTunes like, with a wide variety of options for different classes available for purchase, around $3.99 to $5.99 or so, or a $7.99 per month subscription. If you sign up, you get 25 free meditations. I wasn’t impressed with the store on my Macbook air, which had several broken links and loaded samples indefinitely- the iphone version worked better. This seems to be a common theme as the iTunes reviews are either ecstatic or angry because the app and store were buggy. It crashed on my iPhone after limited use (twice). Some of the courses are kind of cheesy: “The Art of Sexual Invitation”, etc. 4.5 star rating. Integrates with the health kit. My choice: I kept the Meditation Studio app on my phone. If I subscribed to a service, I would probably choose Calm, unless the Omvana store and app become less buggy in the future. Tell me what you think in the comments below! Have you tried any of these apps? Or do you use a different app?
Before we start, this is just a note that this is a guide designed for the absolute beginners in trading. How beginner, you ask? Well, we have sat down with an experienced trader to ask the all important questions about trading to teach us, absolute novices, all about the world of trading. Where does the beginner start? How much do you have to learn? Well, the answer is, PLENTY. In fact, the learnings never end. Not only do you have to keep yourself constantly researching, but you have to be on top of new strategies and possibilities all the time. So, keeping this in mind, we asked the trader the basic questions that you would have to know to get into the game and how to actually make a profit out of this tricky world. Why would you go into trading if you have never done it before? People go into trading for various reasons. You need to make up your mind what the exact reasons are for you wanting to enter the trading space so that you don’t put yourself in a bad position. Decide what your reasons are for going into trading in the first place. Are you looking to make some extra money to pay for your children’s education, a dream trip or to put away for retirement? Or is this the start of your new, exciting career? Being a local trader and a once a week trader are totally different animals. Based on your answer, you can start determining what your timeline is in trading. Absolutely! There are hundreds of trading platforms out there for you to choose from, but you do need to do some careful research into it as it is quite cut-throat. There are a lot that simply assume that you will lose and take your trades. What is great is that a lot of the platforms can be accessed through desktop and mobile, and many allow you to build your own personalized trading hub. If someone was launching themselves into trading for the first time ever, what would your ultimate piece of advice be? If you are first starting out, the first thing you need to get sorted is a risk management strategy. You can have the greatest indicators and the best strategy on how to trade, but if your targets and what profits you are taking and stop loss orders are wrong, you can still not make money. So, basically you have to look at trades and see how they have performed in the past and what their historical movement looks like. If you are capable of doing a statistical study on it, do a stat study on what you need your stop level to be and how much loss you can take. You ultimately need to, going into the trade, know what your profit level needs to be and stick to that as rigorously as possible. When you execute a trade and buy something, the market could possibly go against you. This is when you start losing money, which is absolutely normal when trading. The market goes through peaks and dips and you need to know just how much you can take. At some point you have to know when to exist the trade for a loss and the loss level cannot be higher than what your take take profits are. You have to have a lot higher success rate than losing, which falls within your strategic planning. This is where it comes to you getting your trading strategy right and then sticking to it. Once a trader gets a trading strategy that works, most stick to them as long as they making a profit. If you are looking to take ten ticks on the trade then stick to taking ten ticks instead of having a ten tick stop loss or something along those lines. A tick is essentially the change in trading price from trade. The minimum tick size for stocks trading above $1 is 1 cent. Setting targets depends on the reason why you are doing the trade. If there is a technical reason for it, you have to make sure that you set your timescale and stick to it. What is a reasonable level to make profit from it to is a question you have to be asking yourself too. Setting this limit is important as obviously everyone wants to make hundreds and hundreds of ticks, but it is not always reasonable all the time. Market conditions are also one of the biggest determinants of when to stay and when to exit a trade. If there are huge events globally, you will need to be taking it into account. So, for example, if there big events like nonfarm payrolls out of the US, there are usually large moves on the markets. So, if you have a trade at that time, you will need to have a larger take profit because you are risking more because of the increased volatility of the market. Talking about market conditions, how important is it to keep up to date with what is happening globally? Wake up and read the news. Go to bed reading the news. Most of the life of a trader is doing research and keeping the research in front of you while trading in order to make good choices and decisions. Everyone is trying to stay as well informed as possible to not get caught out by buying something that happens on the global scale. There are tons of accurate and up to date news wires that you can subscribe to. But they are usually quite expensive. Market Squawks have all of the major screens like Bloomberg and Reuters which is always updated. They put out daily calendars and research papers to keep you updated with global events and market movements. Twitter is also great for breaking news for you to keep an eye on, although you need to keep watching the feeds and trends to make sure that it is accurate. This also depends on what type of time period you are looking at trading over. Locals in the trade arena, which are the regular traders who trade several times a day need to have an in-depth knowledge. Other strategies mean that you only trade a few times a week, and this will mean that you don’t need to be quite as in depth in market movements. In saying this, it is important to have a proper risk strategy in place as you can land yourself in trouble. Hence why having the risk strategy was the first and foremost most important thing to have before launching your trading career. In ending, the greatest advice given, is not to follow the pack. Don’t do exactly what everyone else does all the time. Take time to work on your strategy and refine it over time. Take all of the main considerations into mind. Time frames, profit margins, your ultimate risk appetite. Don’t get down when something does not work out and when you see a fall in the market. Keep at it. But also be savvy enough to know when to cut your losses. ← Stock vs. Forex Trading – what to choose?
Help the USTA provide relief those affected by Hurricane Sandy. In the wake of the devastation left behind by Hurricane Sandy, hundreds of thousands of people in the Northeast are without basic necessities and are in need of help. New York, New Jersey and Connecticut were particularly hard-hit by the storm. The staff of the USTA, based in White Plains, N.Y., and the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, located in the borough of Queens, have been working to help gather and donate some of these necessities, including water, warm clothing, blankets, toiletries and other personal items to our neighbors in need. If you’d like to lend a hand, there are several ways in which you can help. Queens Mamas, 23-74 38th Street, before 7pm, and through the weekend. Woodhaven Development Corp, Forest Parkway and Jamaica Avenue. Atlas Park Mall, at the old Borders Store, 8000 Cooper Ave. For additional information on donating and volunteering opportunities throughout the hurricane-afflicted tri-state area, visit the Red Cross at redcross.org, the Salvation Army at salvationarmyusa.org or AmeriCares at americares.org. NewYorkcares.org also is accepting cash donations and provides a list of volunteer opportunities in the New York area.
Over the past week we have repeatedly exposed the BLS' shennanigans to both keep the headline unemployment rate suppressed and to generate an upward bias in the market courtesy of a "bigger than expected beat" of expectations. Granted, various semantics experts continue to scratch their heads in attempting to explain a collapsing labor force when even Goldman's Sven Jari Stehn just predicted that it will drop to 63.1% by the end of 2012 (and 62.5% by the end of 2015). Funny then that the US will have no unemployment left when the participation rate drops to 58.5%. And no, the "population soared argument based on revised data" doesn't quite cut it when the bulk of said surge not only did not get a job, but was not even counted toward the labor force. Yet what the biggest flaw with all these arguments that vainly (and veinly) attempt to defend the US economy as if it is growing, is that they focus exclusively on the quantity of jobs, doctored or not, and completely ignore the quality. We have decided to step in and fill this void. By now, most of our readers know that every incremental dollar of public debt leads to less than one dollar of GDP growth, courtesy of the debt/GDP ratio having surpassed 100% a month ago. Yet what most don't know is that the marginal utility of public debt is not the only thing that may have peaked: as of January 31, 2012, the date of the most recent BLS jobs report, it appears that the "marginal utility" of job formation (if such a concept existed) also turned negative. And since it doesn't exist, yet, allows us to explain. While the BLS is the best, if massively seasonally adjusted, tracker of job quantity, the only true indicator of job quality is the FMS's Daily Treasury Statement, which tracks and updates how much government revenue is generated any given day courtesy of withheld income and employment taxes. So to avoid any potential semantic confusion, we will stick to numbers and bullets: hopefully even the most dedicated newsletter sellers and "asset managers" can follow those without losing much in translation. In the fiscal year 2011 and 2012 (starting October 1) and continuing through the date of the most recent BLS update or January 31, there have been 87 official work days. This is the period which we will define as YTD (fiscal year to date period) for 2012, and will use its matched equivalent for 2011 for comparative purposes. In other words, the US Treasury collected $310 million more in tax withholdings in the first 4 months of fiscal 2011 than in the first 4 months of fiscal 2012. Presented visually - the black bar shows the cumulative divergence between the fiscal 2011 and 2012 data series. Below zero, such as that on January 31, is bad. Said otherwise, in the first 4 months of fiscal 2011 the US "created" 571,000 jobs; in the first 4 months of 2012, the US "created" 715,000 jobs. More importantly, between January 31, 2011 and January 31, 2012 the US added 1,953,000 jobs. Over the same period, as shown above tax withholdings are actually trending lower in 2012 compared to 2011! The 130.456MM workers "employed" at January 31, 2011 created a total of $592.985MM in withholdings, or on average of $4,545.48 per worker over the first 4 months of the fiscal year 2011. The 132.409MM workers "employed" at January 31, 2012 created a total of $592.675MM in withholdings, or on average of $4,476.09 per worker over the first 4 months of the fiscal year 2012. Translation: based on the above, even as America was "creating" jobs, 2 million to be precise (and 2.5 million between Sept 30, 2010 and January 31, 2012), the government tax revenues created by these jobs actually declined in 2012 compared to 2011, on a per job basis, by roughly 1.5%! This analysis ignores completely any seasonal fudging, census adjustments, "updated population controls" and all those other "fudge factors" which keep BLS Ph.D.s employed (especially during election years). It is pure math based on numbers reported by both the US Treasury and the BLS. This analysis also has substantial ramifications on the Treasury's forecast debt issuance schedule, which is driven substantially based on model assumptions for tax withholdings. Alas, absent some massive surge in income, and thus increased tax withholdings, going forward, we see no reason why there should be any material upside in government income tax revenues in 2012 compared to 2011. Which means that absent significant spending cuts, which we all know will never happen, the US is about to substantially underestimate just how much debt it has to issue for fiscal Q2 and Q3. Needless to say, this also means that the debt ceiling in such a case, would be breached far sooner than even in our pessimistic scenario of early November 2012. Finally, and most, importantly, we hope that this analysis has proven that while the BLS may play around with various numerators, denominators, seasonal adjustments, and other irrelevant gimmicks which are only fit for popular consumption particularly by those who have never used excel in their lives, a deeper analysis confirms our concerns, that not only is America slipping ever further into a state of permanent "temp job" status, but that a "quality analysis" of the jobs created shows that the US job formation machinery is badly hurt, and just like the marginal utility of debt now hitting a critical inflection point, so the "marginal utility" of incremental jobs is now negative, which means that Obama, or whichever administration, can easily represent to be growing jobs, and declining the unemployment rate by whatever gimmick necessary. Yet these very jobs are now generating far less in so very critical tax revenue for the US treasury, and continue to declining steadily in quality.

Van Jones and Kim Kardashian just announced that President Trump is signing the First Step Act in an effort at prison reform (see video below). While the left tries to divide us, President Trump is working so hard to make all Americans have a better life and that includes helping former prison inmates receive incentives to reenter society as productive citizens. This is something all Americans can work together on…Thank you President Trump!
Kissing under the mistletoe…decorating with evergreen wreaths, silver bells and red holly…baking sugar cook­ies…brightly wrapped surprises waiting to be opened… singing carols by a crackling fire… The holiday season is upon us, bring­ing beloved and time-honored traditions, memories and goodies in its festive wake. This year—thanks to a collaboration between the New York City Ballet (NYCB) and the Tonner Doll Co. (TDC) that brings a new ex­pression to a beloved symbol of the season—all good doll collectors (if you’ve been naughty, there’s still hope) can look forward to a delightful gift. In celebration of its sponsorship of the 2006 Nutcracker Family Benefit supporting NYCB and its official school, the School of American Ballet, TDC is unveiling graceful ballerina dolls. The collection’s designs are based on and inspired by the original costumes of NYCB’s production of George Balanchine’s The Nutcracker™. The NYCB dolls, approximately 16 inches tall, boast multiple articulated joints, including bending wrists. Dolls are sculpted with stationary en pointe feet (one style is made with standard high-heel arched fashion feet) and feature a smaller bustline than traditional Tyler-style 16-inch fashion dolls. The Emilie head sculpt is used on all 16-inch dolls in the debut NYCB collection; it is not the same as the Cinderella’s Wicked Stepsister Euphemia head sculpt, which is also a new sculpt. The dolls will help bring the ballet’s magical fantasy into collectors’ homes and recapture fond childhood memories of the holiday ballet, and all the excitement and anticipation this special season brings. While the 1892 version of The Nutcracker is now the most popular, it was the least well known of Tschaikovksy’s ballets until George Balanchine staged his adaptation in 1954. A resounding success, George Balanchine’s The Nutcracker™ has become an enchanting introduction in the artistry and grace of the ballet for generations of children. The ballet also marked one of the most important artistic collaborations of the 20th century—that of George Balanchine and the great costume de­signer, Barbara Karinska. Beyond music and choreography, production de­sign can be a signature element of a ballet. According to Robert Daniels, NYCB’s managing director of marketing and communications, the “leo­tard ballets” or the “black and white ballets” serve as visual signatures. “The dan­cers are costumed in black and white leotards, and the backdrop for the ballet is most often a deep blue scrim,” he notes. Karinska’s designs for George Balanchine’s The Nutcracker™ “clear­ly merit being memorialized as they are an integral part of a work that has had an extraordinary im­pact on the dance world,” Daniels notes. And who better to memorialize the costumes and capture the Balanchine NYCB vision than Rob­ert Tonner, who has done so much to elevate the quality of miniature couture? On December 9, 2006, when NYCB and the School of American Ballet present their annual Nutcracker Family Benefit, TDC will be the proud sponsor. It was during the discussions about this sponsorship opportunity that the idea for the NYCB collection em­erged. The result: a three-year lic­ense enabling TDC to re­produce costumes from any of the ballets in the NYCB repertoire costumed by Madame Karinska. The production of this specialized collection has enabled Tonner to em­ploy the 16-inch fashion doll body he first created for Tyler Wentworth. In doing so, however, the body required some re-engineering to more accurately capture a ballerina’s style and grace. For the collection, Tonner opted for the small bust torso developed for the Memoirs of a Geisha collection and the bending wrist articulation developed for Tyler. Joe Petrollese, TDC’s design director, visited NYCB at its Lincoln Center home and had a field day studying and photographing the costumes housed there for the details and inspiration necessary for their re-creation. Petrollese also notes the decorative detail on some of the actual costumes can be quite large and out of scale in order for them to be seen from the stage. These had to be reduced to proper scale for the miniature reproductions. When collectors re­ceive the “Sugar Plum Fairy” pictured on DOLLS’ Holiday 2007 cover, they can admire the small “sugar plums” and “spun sugar” ribbons on the costume, details that a photograph could not fully capture. George Balanchine’s The Nut­cracker™ will provide much opportunity for humor and delight as the costumes from the visit by Marie and her Nutcracker Prince to the Land of Sweets are reproduced. One can just imagine peppermint candy canes in their stripes of green, white and pink as they dance before the Prince and Prin­cess, marzipan shepherd­esses and other “sweet treats” to enchant and inspire. For many of these, collectors will have to wait, however. But, hopefully in time to grace our holiday décor, Tonner and Petrollese have selected to reproduce the two costumes worn by the Sugar Plum Fairy in the ballet. The Sugar Plum Fairy in her pas de deux in the Land of Sweets wears the costume featured on the cover. The other is her romantic long pink tutu, which is a featured part of the FAO exclusive NYCB trunk set. Also available will be the “Dance of the Lady Doll,” which wears the costume appearing in the ballet during the Christmas Eve party. Two of Marie’s costumes are also reproduced: “Marie’s Special Gift,” which she is wearing when her godfather gives her the gift of the Nutcracker, and “Off to the Land of Sweets,” her sleep ensemble for the transition to the dream sequence. Other costumes in the NYCB collection—“L’Hiver,” “Spanish Rose” and “Swan Lake”— were designed by TDC and are not actual reproductions. Among the offerings for the 2007 collection will be a lovely “Coppelia,” as well as a rehearsal doll. The latter, wearing the NYCB T-shirt and jeans, will be the only fashion-footed doll in the NYCB collection. So, this holiday season, if you can’t make it to your nearest ballet theater production of The Nutcracker, check out the movie version by the same name. With Tonner’s “Sugar Plum Fairy” or “Dance of the Lady Doll” in hand, you will thrill to the rich movement of color across the stage as you dream about the next “must haves” for your collection.

The MAC Global Solar Energy Index (“Underlying Index”) is designed to provide exposure to companies listed on exchanges in developed markets that derive a significant amount of their revenues from the following business segments of the solar industry: solar power equipment producers including ancillary or enabling products such as tracking systems, inverters, or batteries; suppliers of raw materials, components or services to solar producers or developers; companies that produce solar equipment fabrication systems; companies involved in solar power system installation, development, integration, maintenance, or finance; or companies that sell electricity derived from solar power. The Index Provider currently defines developed markets as the following countries: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. While the equity securities comprising the Underlying Index are traded in developed markets, the issuers of such securities may be located in emerging markets. Emerging market countries are countries that major international financial institutions, such as the World Bank, generally consider to be less economically mature than developed nations. Emerging market countries can include every nation in the world except the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and most countries located in Western Europe. The MAC Global Solar Energy Index is designed to track the global solar energy equity sector. The MAC Global Solar Energy Index is constructed as follows. Companies that qualify for inclusion in the Underlying Index must derive a significant portion of their revenue, measured by the methodology set forth below, from operating in the following business segments of the solar industry: solar power equipment producers including ancillary or enabling products such as tracking systems, inverters, or batteries; suppliers of raw materials, components or services to solar producers or developers; companies that produce solar equipment fabrication systems; companies involved in solar power system installation, development, integration, maintenance, or finance; or companies that sell electricity derived from solar power. Pure-Play Group — Companies that generate in excess of two thirds of their revenue from solar related business are considered to have their primary business in the solar industry and are placed in the Pure-Play Group. These are assigned an “Exposure Factor” of 1.0. Medium-Play Group — Companies that operate in multiple industries but have significant exposure to the solar industry — defined as generating less than approximately two thirds but more than approximately one third of their revenue from solar related business — are placed in the Medium-Play Group. These are assigned an Exposure Factor of 0.5. Eliminated Group — Companies with marginal exposure to the solar industry — defined as generating less than approximately one third of their revenue from solar related business — are eliminated from consideration as an Underlying Index constituent. From the securities in the Pure-Play Group and Medium-Play Group, securities eligible for inclusion in the Underlying Index that are not existing constituents of the Underlying Index must be listed on a developed market exchange, as defined below, have a minimum market capitalization greater than or equal to $150 million at the reference date preceding each rebalance, and have a minimum one month average daily trading value of $750,000 at the reference date preceding each rebalance. Securities in the Pure-Play Group or Medium-Play Group that do not meet these criteria are excluded from consideration as an Underlying Index constituent. Securities that are already in the Underlying Index are not subject to the minimum market capitalization and trading value to remain constituents of the Underlying Index. The float-adjusted market capitalization for each security is multiplied by its Exposure Factor of either 1.0 or 0.5, meaning the market capitalization for the securities in the Pure-Play Group is taken at full value and for the Medium-Play Group is reduced by one half. The resulting adjusted market capitalizations are used to create a standard market-capitalization-weighted index with raw weighting factors. If necessary, the raw weighting factors are modified through a weighting-gap rebalancing algorithm to ensure that, at the time of rebalance, no security in the Underlying Index has an individual weighting greater than 10% and that the aggregate weighting of securities in the Underlying Index with individual weightings of more than 4.5% is no more than 45.0% of the total Underlying Index. The weighting-gap rebalancing algorithm progressively reduces the weighting gap between adjacent securities, as ranked by their raw weighting factors, on a proportional basis, until the weighting parameters specified above are met. The Index Provider may adjust the weights to account for liquidity, solar exposure, ownership, or diversification factors. The Underlying Index in addition follows an “80% investment policy” whereby at least 80% of the combined weight of the index constituents must be represented by companies that derive at least 50% of their revenues from the solar industry. Stocks with less than 50% solar revenue will either be dropped from the Index, not included in the Index, or have a weight adjustment to the extent necessary to comply with this policy. If an Underlying Index constituent is determined to be delisted; illiquid; in bankruptcy or debt restructuring proceedings; acquired; or in extreme legal, regulatory or financial distress, that constituent may be removed from the index effective immediately and the stock will not be replaced. An Underlying Index constituent that is under a trading halt or suspension will be reviewed on an ongoing basis for possible deletion. A spin-off from an existing Underlying Index constituent will automatically be included in the Underlying Index if it meets the standard Underlying Index criteria but will be dropped from the Underlying Index as soon as is reasonably practicable if the spun-off company does not meet the standard Underlying Index constituent criteria. A company that recently completed an initial public offering (“IPO”) and that meets the criteria above can be considered for inclusion as an Underlying Index constituent only at the time of the quarterly Underlying Index rebalance, and only after the security has completed at least two (2) months of trading history. constituent weightings may be adjusted to reflect a change in the Exposure Factor for a particular stock, the addition or deletion of Underlying Index constituents and/or the need to meet the specified weighting requirements. Constituent stocks must be listed on exchanges in the following countries: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. While the equity securities in the Underlying Index are traded in developed markets, the issuers of such securities may be located in emerging markets. Emerging market countries are countries that major international financial institutions, such as the World Bank, generally consider to be less economically mature than developed nations. Emerging market countries can include every nation in the world except the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and most countries located in Western Europe.

Along the lines of my New Zealand predictions, I’ve tried to determine how the Melbourne race might unfold. My usual caveat applies: This is a statistical prediction, and doesn’t take race dynamics, form on race day and a lot of other factors into account. But it should give you a good indication of what to expect on race day and identify potential surprises. If you have your own opinion on who is going to win this race, please check-out IM Betting and you can win a nice price! Luke Dragstra and I have put together this site – you can submit your picks for the top 10 on the men’s side and the top 6 for the women. The best bets (overall, men and women) and a random drawing will win some nice prices from our partners Planet X and Magic Sportfood such as a Carbon wheel set, a bike jersey with matching shorts and a tri-suit or tri-top and tri-short. Clayton Fettel is probably the fastest swimmer in the field – he will probably be about three minutes ahead of the main field. After him, the distances will be small and all the big names should be close together, three (Crowie) to five minutes (Cam) back. Clayton will continue to lead on the bike, and only Marino will be able to make up time on him (probably without closing the gap completely). After these there will be a group with Crowie, Eneko, David Dellow and Joe Gambles, around five minutes back. Luke Bell might be able to hold on to the group, and Jordan Rapp might be able to ride up to them. The race for third will also be pretty close, similar to last year we may have big groups running together. Candidates for the last podium spot are Eneko (probably the best runner of these), David Dellow (who might have improved further), Cam Brown (looking to repeat his great 2012 performance and redeem himself for the third position in his home race), Jordan Rapp (who said on Twitter he is “here for the win”) and potential dark horse Victor del Corral (winner of IM Lanzarote). With such a group of athletes, anything can happen. The list of potential leaders after the swim is very short: Amanda Stevens is simply the best female swimmer in the IM circuit. After her, there will already be some gaps between the next athletes. Caroline will be about 4:30 back, Yvonne over 10 minutes. There will be a bigger group of athletes around 13 minutes back, look for Natascha Badmann and Corinne Abraham. Xena will take the lead within an hour on the bike, and will open a big gap. I expect her lead after the bike to be more than 8 minutes, even without posting another world best IM bike time as she did last year. Meredith Kessler will be in second place for most of the bike, behind her Yvonne should gain a few spots and finish the bike pretty close to MBK. The race for third will also be quite interesting: The numbers project both Natascha and Gina overtaking Meredith, but I’m sure that Meredith will have a lot of confidence after holding on to her lead in IM New Zealand. Behind these three, Corinne Abraham should have the strongest run, but she will probably be too far back after the bike to join the fight for third.
GLENDALE–A delegation of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation Western US Central Committee met with Armenia’s foreign minister Vartan Oskanian Sunday at the Glendale Hilton Hotel. Also taking part in the meeting were Armenia’s ambassador to the US Armand Kirakosian and Armenia’s Consul General to Los Angeles Valery Mkrtoumian. The brunt of the meeting focused on a discussion about the recent Congressional waiver of Section 907–the so-called "Armenian-Turkish Reconciliation Commission" and issues related to the signing of a memorandum of understanding between Armenia and the State of California. The ARF delegation conveyed its concern and position regarding the aforementioned issues and Oskanian expressed Armenia’s official posturing on those matters.

FILE — Michael Larobina, Director of Legal Affairs. STAMFORD -- Director of Legal Affairs Michael Larobina defended his handling of legal issues related to the ongoing ethics proceedings and explained the city's settlement with former Board of Finance Chairman Joe Tarzia during a meeting with city representatives last week. Larobina appeared before the Board of Representatives Legislative and Rules Committee on April 25 to explain the February arrangement that resulted in Tarzia's abrupt resignation from public office. Tarzia, first elected to the Board of Finance in 1987, had been battling several ethics violation charges at the time of his departure. One charge, filed by Human Resources Generalist Tania Barnes in April 2010, alleged Tarzia asked two city employees, Director of Operations Ernie Orgera and Parks Superintendent Mickey Docimo, to intervene in the disciplining of a vehicle maintenance worker. Another complaint, filed by City Fleet Manager Michael Scacco, alleged Tarzia, along with City Rep. Sal Gabriele, R-16, and Republican finance board member Bob Kolenberg, "led a campaign of harassment and retaliation" against him after he attempted to discipline city equipment mechanic James Fasoli. The city's deal with Tarzia ended public ethics hearings on the complaints. The arrangement was a settlement of a federal lawsuit Tarzia had filed against the city in October 2010, Larobina said. An ethical dilemma: Who should pay? Tarzia was paid $45,000 in exchange for dropping the lawsuit, resigning from municipal office, and withdrawing all ethics complaints and Freedom of Information requests he had filed. "In my mind, it was simply a question of stemming the hemorrhaging of taxpayer dollars to defend and pay legal fees to outside counsel to defend this frivolous lawsuit, that, in our opinion had no merit," Larobina said. "The decision was that we would spend more money litigating and defending this suit than we would to settle it. And we do that every day. We settle lawsuits every day." Committee Chair Eileen Heaphy asked Larobina how much money he estimated the settlement saved taxpayers. "I'm sure that we would have expended at least twice or three times the amount of what we paid out in legal fees," Larobina said. "The case really hadn't gone very far at that point. We spent a significant amount of money." A breakdown of the more than $130,000 Stamford has spent on legal fees related to the past year's ethics proceedings shows the city paid the Law Office of Byelas & Neigher $42,390 for legal representation related to the federal lawsuit, in addition to the $45,000 settlement. It also spent an estimated $30,000 on legal fees incurred by the Board of Ethics in connection with the complaint filed against Tarzia and Kolenberg. Arthur Layton, the committee vice chair, asked Larobina if the settlement stipulated Tarzia could not run for municipal office again or speak adversely about the city following his resignation. Larobina said the agreement did not include these requirements. City Rep. Jay Fountain, D-7, asked about the status of the ethics complaints filed against Tarzia. Larobina said they had been withdrawn. "Contrary to what some people have suggested, if you look at the ordinance, the Board of Ethics only has what we call in the law jurisdiction over individuals if they are a city employee, officer or elected official," Larobina said. "Once you cease to become one of those things, the board has no jurisdiction over you." The Stamford Code of Ethics section on "continuing investigations," however, gives the Board of Ethics jurisdiction to pursue ethics inquiries even after the person in question has left a position with the city. "If an officer or employee under investigation leaves office or employment, the Board by a majority vote shall have the power to continue the investigation," the Code says. Heaphy said she was glad Larobina clarified the circumstances surrounding the settlement. "I think that the important thing was getting it on the record and in the open," she said. "I think they did a fair and honest job with it. They came to a conclusion that saved the city a lot more problems, so I have to say that was wise on their part." City Rep. Harry Day, R-13, said he was happy with Larobina's explanation. "I'm a lawyer also and if I had been in Mike's shoes, I would have done exactly what he did," Day said. "It was a deal that was premised on here we are, and let's just resolve where we are. It didn't look back, it didn't look forward. It just resolved what was in front of them." Larobina also answered questions from committee remembers regarding his department's stance on providing legal representation to city officials accused of ethics violations. Last spring, the city paid $3,000 for an attorney for Tarzia before deciding he would be responsible for his own legal fees unless he was cleared of the ethics charges against him. "Initially Mr. Tarzia made a demand for his legal representation to be paid by the city," Larobina said. "Our initial position was that we would do that. Upon my insistence, I gathered the senior attorneys in the law department and asked for further research on this matter." Larobina said he spent four or five hours researching the issue with three other attorneys in his office. They concluded the city was not legally obligated to provide upfront legal representation for city officials accused of ethics violations. "We made a decision to change course," he said. "Practicing attorneys do this all the time. You take a position, you do further research, you reflect and you decide that you're going to go in a different direction." City Rep. John Zelinsky, D-11, said he was concerned volunteer elected officials would be deterred from serving on Stamford boards and commissions if they felt they could be liable for large legal expenses. "What's to stop somebody from filing an ethics complaint against anybody ... and we have to go out and retain an attorney to defend us possibly in a suit that really has no merit?" Zelinsky said. Larobina said the issue would need to be taken up with the state Legislature. "As your legal representation, let me tell you what your options are," he said. "You need to address this with the Connecticut General Assembly. Those are your options." Board of Ethics Chair Dan Young said Wednesday he intends to address the subject at Thursday's meeting, which will be held in part to discuss possible recommendations for improvements to the ethics code. "I don't know what other board members will think, but I intend to raise the issue of whether we should recommend to the Board of (Representatives) that they make a rule about when/whether participants get their attorneys' fees paid for," Young said in an email. Thursday's Board of Ethics meeting will be held at 7 p.m. in the Board of Representatives, legislative chambers at the Government Center. It is open to the public.

I totally agree with these six simple steps that you have listed out here, this is very necessary to have a good healthy relationship.

Its better go with truth angle, I feel. Truth is bitter but it might help in solving problems and prevents making relationship worse. In a relationship where boyfriends are involved, sorry works only if it means something. And truth might help a lot. Here, how not to lose your mind says something really helpful in boyfriend series- when he says sorry. When boyfriends says sorry it is good to keep quiet for sometime (I know we feel like exploding, but they should have a chance too, right? We ought to play fair!) 😛 let him explain his point of view give him a chance of saying sorry. It is preferable to let boyfriends speak when they really feel sorry. Understanding the deed from every angle is very important. This is so helpful. Sometimes neither yours nor your boyfriends’ sorry matters. What matters is how you understand the gravity of the situation. If not boyfriends, then you ought to be understanding when it comes to handling arguments. Also, a simple sorry can also save a relation! I agree. It’s not wrong to ask for some time to recover. We are humans afterall. Doing it for lame reasons is stupid, ofcourse. Also, we should keep in mind when we need time to recover, boyfriends also need time. Even they have been through the same situation. Sorry and time always help. Mixing other grievances might make the situation worse! Staying focused to one situation always helps! Also, there is no use bottling up that anger and venting it out all at once. It will freak out your boyfriends! Also don’t apologize when its not your mistake. Also don’t let that poor thing (boyfriend) apologize when its not his mistake as well! Make plans to leave your boyfriend. Identify a safe haven, such as a domestic violence shelter or the home of a friend your boyfriend doesn’t know. When you decide to leave your boyfriend, you make the fake reality your boyfriend has constructed weaker. He may not change, but he might begin to recognize what his behavior did to you. Look at your boyfriend’s controlling behaviors when he is not with you. Take the time to remember a specific event and take it apart, bit by bit. He wants to isolate you and make you fully dependent on him so he’ll urge you to quit your job or drop out of school. In effect, your boyfriend wants to define who you are. Your boyfriend has experienced a psychological disconnection in one of his four psychological functions–sensing, intuiting, feeling and thinking. Conduct an experiment, but do so only if your boyfriend is not physically dangerous to you. Make a statement such as, “I feel like eating pizza tonight.” If your boyfriend says, “No, you won’t like it,” respond with, “What?” He should repeat, “No, you won’t like the pizza.” Say, “What?” When you respond with these non-arguments, you are refusing to validate what your boyfriend is telling you, says Tower of Power. At some point during a conversation like this, your boyfriend will realize what you are doing and will tell you to stop.

Gothic Fiction - What is it and how did it come about? Gothic fiction, also known as Gothic horror combines elements of both horror and romance. The first ever gothic novel is regarded to be The Castle of Otranto by the English author Horace Walpole back in 1764 – so he would have effectively pioneered the genre. Gothic fiction feeds on a pleasing sort of terror mixed with elements of romance. It is dark, exciting, mysterious, melodramatic, full of deep and passionate feelings and oodles of atmosphere. It is intimately associated with the Gothic Revival architecture of that era and in the same way rejects clarity and rationalism preferring the joys of extreme emotion, the thrills of fearfulness and awe inherent in the sublime, as well as a quest for atmosphere. It is important to understand that the ruins of gothic buildings were very much linked to strong emotions as they represented the inevitable decay and collapse of human creations. English landscape parks of the time would even add fake ruins for this kind of effect and feeling. Medieval buildings were seen by English Gothic writers as representing a dark and terrifying period, of harsh laws enforced by heavy punishments including torture – an era steeped in mystery, fanaticism for example anti-Catholicism and the Inquisition, and superstitious rituals. There are a number of prominent features of Gothic fiction. These include both psychological and physical terror, mystery, secrets, darkness, decay, death, the supernatural, ghosts, haunted houses, elaborate but crumbling castles and Gothic architecture, hereditary curses and madness. Gothic fiction characters often include Byronic heroes, tyrants, evil villains, maniacs and madmen, femmes fatales, persecuted maidens, insane women, magicians, paranormal characters for example vampires, werewolves and monsters, ghosts, the Devil and so forth. All of this put together with clever twists in the storyline makes Gothic Fiction a fascinating read. Taking the reader out of reality and pushing them out of their comfort zone – into a world of decaying beauty, deep passions and dark secrets. Where love can be eternal and anything and everything can happen in the stormiest yet most breath-taking ways. It is a genre that guarantees that while reading, you will leave this everyday world behind and step into a whole new other – leagues away from everything you’d come to know. My novel Morgan Hall is everything a Gothic novel should be – almost all of the above. In addition to this, I have also moved all of that as it is, literally, into our modern world, and you will be able to relate to the characters and what they are feeling but still be left with that very overwhelming Gothic rush and that sense of “wow”! So come and have a go – experience “Morgan Hall” by Bo Briar. Morgan Hall is a gothic fiction novel that definitely has the right atmosphere as it's set in an old English manor that has been in the Morgan family for centuries and comes complete with pounding rain and unusual thunderstorms, lush countryside, eerie woods, sparkling streams and ponds, and a house full of secrets and unease. As per many of these novels, the main character, Christie Morgan, begins seeing spirits, hearing strange noises, has unusual things happen to her, and then is tormented by events that grow more dangerous and eerie as the days move on. While I found the setting to be quite fascinating, and thought the descriptions of the houses were quite good, I'm afraid the characters themselves are what actually drove me to give it the rating that I did as I enjoyed the descriptions far more than I enjoyed the characters. Don't get me wrong as I enjoy a good gothic fiction novel and have been hooked since I discovered my grandmother's stash in her bedroom (in French and in English) when I was twelve years old. And while I really enjoyed the atmosphere in this novel, especially the pounding rain and the early darkness (perhaps I am rain-deprived in this drought-ridden July?) but I could envision everything so clearly and that is clearly due to the author's good writing skills when it comes to describing events and settings. I would even say I enjoyed the plot to a certain extent although it did seem to get caught up in the descriptions and in the characters' love triangle, but I like old family secrets and things that have been kept hidden for centuries, so perhaps I am a bit of a sap for things like that. My biggest issue with Morgan Hall was the characters as they kind of got on my nerves. Christie, the last living descendent of Morgan Hall, became one big mess as things kept happening to her and I was often saying, "Where's your backbone, girl?" I just don't have the patience for women who are constantly crying (I realize this is just my issue and many people don't have a problem with this: It's something I need to work on.). And what particularly drove me crazy was the sudden development of this love triangle thing. Yes, I could predict something would happen, but it was how it happened that I wasn't overly crazy over, but then I am never crazy about these insta-love things so this would never have appealed to me. The whole flow of the situation didn't quite sit right with me and I thought the characters behaved like young, spoiled children and it really bothered me. I actually really liked Jonathan, the gamekeeper, and thought he was the most level-headed of the bunch. Morgan Hall definitely has all the markings of a gothic fiction novel and I enjoyed seeing all of these elements in play; the spooky hall, the temperamental weather, the unexplained events, etc... And while the descriptions of the various homes were quite well done, I felt like the plot and the characters didn't quite live up to expectations. But the potential is definitely there, and I hope Ms. Briar will continue to write gothic fiction for those of us who can't quite get enough. When a childhood love he thought was dead, appears on his doorstep during their investigation, Connor is forced to confront memories he convinced himself were the delusions of a man deep into grief. They are being stalked by a mysterious man who appears to know far too many of their secrets. After Alison is almost killed confronting her occult past, it is impossible for Connor to deny the connection between the cases. Someone is attempting to end Connor’s life and the lives of all those who surround him. When I first came up with the story of Nightfall it began with the characters. I envisioned their style, attitudes and relationships long before I could think of where I wanted the story to take place. As the story came together the scenes just sort of fell into place. Each scene required a certain tone and I envisioned a specific setting for the scene to take place but I still didn’t have an overall setting for the entirety of Nightfall. I only had pieces that I needed to assemble. I had Connor’s home, an old forgotten building, a house under renovation, a pizzeria and a closed down jail. All of these settings I had visited or experienced at some point. The most notable was certainly the closed down jail. In Windsor, Vermont there is an old former jail-prison that was closed in the 70’s that was subsequently renovated and turned into low-income housing. The structure remains fairly well intact including the old death row. This was one setting that I really wanted to feature in the story. On the whole, there were a multitude of scenes but I still couldn’t decide on the definitive setting for the entire story. It wasn’t until I took a trip to Salem, Massachusetts that I found the elements Nightfall was missing. Now, there have been countless stories that have used Salem as a setting, and it carries a certain cliché in the paranormal genre yet the reality of the Salem gave me a different inspiration. Modern Salem is a bustling metropolis with the original founding buildings hidden at the center. It’s an interesting mix of historic sites and modern urban development. Through exploring Salem you could wander from historic sites to psychic and witchcraft shops, from pizzerias to True Blood-esque Witch/Vampire bars like Strega. In all, visiting Salem gave me a new perspective. The classic idea of Salem is no longer valid, but all of the surrounding towns like Marblehead and Beverly carry that original New England Township feeling that most still associate with Salem. If I had not actually visited Salem, Nightfall would not be set in Doliber Cove. I would still be under the same impression as most about Salem and elements like sailing on the Massachusetts coast, quirky book shops, and mysterious bars would be absent. Originally from California, PW moved frequently, living in many places including Vermont, Tennessee and currently New York where PW took his interest in adventure to college earning a Bachelors in Folklore Anthropology, Archaeology and Art Studio. After his work was displayed in gallery exhibits and television documentaries, he returned to college for his MSEd as a Communications Specialist in Media Production. Between rock climbing, sailing and investigations, there's barely enough time in the day but it's all a modern adventure. One lucky person is going to be the recipient of an autographed paperback version of Nightfall as well as a copy of Connor's pendant. Jessica Walsh is starting her freshman year at Nightshade High and trying to forget about the tragic events surrounding her brother’s graduation. She wants to have a normal high school experience. But that’s easier said than done in Nightshade. Dead is a Battlefield is the sixth novel in this series, and features Jessica Walsh, a freshman trying desperately to forget the serious events that surrounded her brother's graduation. I thoroughly enjoyed the previous novels in this series and wondered where the author was going to take this series when this one popped into my mailbox one day. And although I enjoyed it, I can't honestly say I enjoyed it as much as the earlier novels featuring Daisy. Jessica is an interesting character, but I felt like the author focused too much on the status of her popularity rather than on her character traits and the development of her character which I found to be somewhat erratic. I found her to be somewhat selfish at times and although I liked the fact that she was honest with herself to admit she liked her popularity, it did irk me at times and I kind of found her to be snobbish. Perhaps this will change in future novels as her character develops and she gets put in more serious scrapes which allows her to grow up and be more responsible and mature. The plot is meant to be lighthearted and fun, definitely not complex, and it lives up to that standard set in previous novels. I enjoyed the antics of secondary characters and the various events that continue to plague the town of Nightshade as it was just pure fun. While the main plotline is easily predictable, I enjoyed reading how the various characters worked together to get themselves out of the scrapes with the usual romantic entanglements getting in the way. You have to take the plot with a grain of salt, but the various threads are fun and set up some interesting scenarios for the future. If you are looking for complex, deep plots, then this book and series are definitely not for you, but if you are looking for light entertainment, then you will enjoy this novel. Dead is a Battlefield continues the antics of the various characters introduced in previous novels and puts them in scenarios that are fun and entertaining. While not quite up to the standard of the previous novels featuring Daisy, this one was still fun and lighthearted, and I'm hoping that as Jessica's character develops and matures, and I get used to the change in character focus, Jessica will grow on me as well.
Since 2009, UEBT assessed awareness of biodiversity, and interest in ethical sourcing in 16 different countries. Ten years of research, among 64,000 people, and hundreds of leading companies, has provided several valuable insights that may guide companies and governments in their approaches towards people and biodiversity. 1. Awareness and understanding of biodiversity is growing globally. It is highest among youth. It also increases among lower incomes, becoming more mainstream. 2. Consumers find biodiversity conservation important for their personal well-being and that of generations to come. They want to personally contribute, but don’t know how. 3. Respecting people and biodiversity in purchase behaviour is of growing concern for consumers. Buying products with natural ingredients that are sourced with respect makes them feel good. 4. People expect companies to respect biodiversity, but don’t trust they do. 5. Transparency is becoming essential for consumers. They want more information on packaging and externally validated information on sourcing with respect. 6. Authentic stories, proof of good practices on the ground, and clear communication are key to convince consumers of companies’ respect for people and biodiversity. 7. Millennials (Gen Y & Z) have the highest awareness of biodiversity and can identify brands that respect biodiversity. They value companies that walk the talk by taking concrete actions. 8. Corporate communication on biodiversity by beauty, food, and beverage companies is rising year-on-year. 9. Opportunities exist for brands that wish to position themselves around sourcing with respect for people and biodiversity. Nowadays just Natura Cosmetics is recognised by more than 50% of consumers in Brazil. 10. Consumers are increasingly interested in naturals, and companies are investing in biodiversity based R&D. Complying with evolving Access and Benefit Sharing (ABS) legislation is becoming an increasingly important factor in reputation risk management.

It doesn't sound like money is the big driver for this tour, he and wife just LOVE to travel to ski areas of all types. I bought the map on line. This particular company has A LOT of great ski maps. @DoryBreaux, @Tricia and myself had a chance to tour the motorhome...The shop in the back it real cool. Ya, but does he have a Scout in there? @Dave Petersen , we have similar goals. I'm a few months into my nebulous 5 year plan. The end game is to be retired in an RV and traveling the country to ski and bike. Maybe swim and sail a little, too. Royal, Lady_Salina, Bad Bob and 1 other person like this. That poster of ski areas is better than anything I've been able to find elsewhere. Is there an online source for it you could point to? BEST MAPS EVER - there are many variations one can order. When he came to the little bump where I taught for 20-odd years, he had neither the bus nor the bride. He fell twice on our VW-sized iceball bumps. When the pro racers came to the same place, they all said that hill was the steepest they raced upon. Of course, those bumps were all groomed away for the racers.
Not of This Earth - A professor of archeology sets out on a mission to identify an ancient Mesoamerican ruin and a mysterious anomaly that lies beneath it. The workers she hires to excavate the ruin flee, claiming there are malevolent forces at work. Thinking that they are just superstitious, she and her team disregard the warning and continue to explore the peculiar metallic structure. What starts out as an archeological dig turns into a maelstrom of death and destruction. Alien Strain - When gold becomes scarce on his planet Phanus, Rodin and his bride explore the feasibility of extracting the precious metal from Earth. Prior to their departure, they place a copy of their psyches inside two spheres as an insurance policy. If something were to happen to them, the spheres would give them a second chance at life. Centuries later, their spheres are found in Cambodia as part of a missing person's search for an archeologist and her team. What results is murder, theft, and a battle for survival. Pandora - When a group of NASA scientists are informed that a monolithic gray mass is entrenched in the largest glacier in Antarctica, they set out on a mission in a nuclear submarine to establish contact with it. But first they must penetrate a sheet of ice two and a half miles thick so they can reach a subglacial lake. Much to their dismay, upon entering the lake, they discover that the Russians are intent on doing the same thing. When they launch a torpedo at the American submarine, an unearthly force hurls the Russian sub into the Polar Sea. Just as the scientists are about to make contact with the alien life form, an gigantic earthquake occurs. The few survivors soon experience a series of horrific events that will forever change their lives. Ghost Ship of the Desert - Against the backdrop of the polluted Salton Sea, Investigative Reporter Jonathan Bruckheimer is challenged to prove the existence of an old, land-locked Spanish galleon that many believe is the ghost ship of the desert. It is rumored to contain a large treasure trove of rare black pearls. Things become complicated when Looney, a Native American Indian, who is instrumental to this quest, is murdered. Although the desert town of Brawley is small, the hunger for riches is great. This makes practically everyone in the community a suspect. Risking the wrath of his editor, not to mention personal danger, Bruckheimer is determined to uncover the truth. Does the ghost ship of the desert actually exist? Who murdered Looney and why? Antiquated Astronaut - Due to a freakish anomaly that takes place in the far reaches of space, astronaut Rory Colt ends up back on Earth five hundred years into the future. But the world as he knew it no longer exists. In its place are two dissimilar civilizations. In one society a cyber world of self-gratification provides its occupants with electromechanical enhancements, while the other is comprised of people who emulate life as it was lived in the nineteenth century. When a beautiful woman hybrid lures Rory into her futuristic world, he soon discovers they are being manipulated by an omniscient, electronic immortal who has ensnared them into a terrifying web of betrayal and deceit. To free the new world from the monster's clutches, he must destroy him. But how does one destroy a creature who lives in cyberspace? Well of Souls - Professor Templeton gets a lot more than she bargains for when she agrees to join an expedition whose goal is to find Genghis Khan's tomb. On her quest for his sarcophagus, she stumbles upon an ancient gold medallion. Its inscription enables her to uncover a conspiracy so horrific that not only does it create an international incident, but also causes one man to go insane and another to lose his life. Room of Dark Secrets - While searching for an ancient mystical manuscript, a cardinal jeopardizes his chances of becoming pope by inadvertently disclosing to the media a Vatican conspiracy. A Las Vegas magician is looking for the same book. If he doesn’t locate it, he will lose his job and with it his lavish lifestyle. And if he does find it, he will become famousthat is, if the powers within the book don’t kill him first. Subprime - Set against a backdrop of financial intrigue, Subprime provides the reader with a behind-the-scenes glimpse into the highly charged and unscrupulous world of mortgage lending. Not only must the protagonist navigate his way through the serpentine and sometimes ruthless world of big business, but he must do so amidst treachery and betrayal from a seemingly benign uncle who, consumed with making money, seeks power in much the same way an addict craves drugs. Secrets of El Tovar Canyon - When an unscrupulous antiquities dealer hires an archeologist to uncover the origin of an ancient tablet, he sets off a bizarre chain of events: Ten-thousand-year-old mummies are found in a cave in the Grand Canyon. A golden statue is discovered in the Sphinx’s paw. What's the secret linking Arizona and Egypt? The U.S. Dept. of Defense believes the answer may well put the entire world at risk. The Papyrus Document - When a noted Pakistani archeologist discovers an ancient hand-scribed document, he is murdered. With the help of a forensic pathologist, his son seeks to complete his father's work. But their death becomes more imminent with each step taken, for the content of the document may destroy the foundations of both the Muslim and Christian world. To date, all twelve of my novels contain quest plots. My characters are always searching for "something." They also manage to get themselves into a lot of trouble before they find what they're looking for. What they find isn't nearly as important as the change that occurs within them during the quest. My grandparents were Russian. During the Bolshevik Revolution they fled to China, where my mother was born. I came to America from France at the age of twelve and immediately traded in my French-version of Lederhosen for a pair of jeans. After earning B.A. and M.A. degrees, I wore a number of different career hats, but none of them ever stirred my souluntil I took up writing. I now live in Laguna Niguel, California, with my wife, Sharon. Keeska is my only spectator and critic when I play golf. Believe it or not when I make an errant shot, she yips! She is a wolf, nine generations removed from the wild. In addition, Keeska howls "in tune" to the music my grandson plays on his guitar. My wife and neighbors disagree.

Do you like comic books? Love live-action role play? Do you love cosplay? Jousting? Drawing? Then LumaCon, Petaluma’s own annual youth comic convention, is for you. LumaCon is held the fourth weekend in January, in Petaluma, and this year it took place at Luccesi Park. The convention’s founders include the Petaluma Library, Casa Grande High School, Friends of the Library and the Charles Schulz Museum and Education Center. Copperfield’s Books is also a great partner. The inaugural event in 2015 overflowed its venue at the fairgrounds, and this year’s space was perfect; big enough for separation for quieter events like panels and a Magic; the Gathering tournament, cozy enough to feel like you could see everything and not get lost. The majority of the action took place in the large meeting space called the Assembly. I’ll have more, and more photos, in an upcoming post. next to you. What a great opportunity for a young artist. You could also wander around the lobby and visit tables set up by Friends of the Library, Copperfield’s Books, or several Sonoma County comic book stores, including my favorite, Brian’s Comics. I have to take a minute to credit the Sonoma County Library here, for their approach to comic books. They realize that for many young people, comics are a “gateway” to reading. As one panelist said, when he was a youngster, he read the Classics Illustrated version of Treasure Island. He really liked it. His mom handed him the book and said, “Here’s the extended version.” Far from treating comics, collections and graphic novels as the enemy, the library includes them as fiction, as poetry and as literature. It probably doesn’t hurt that we live in the county with the Charles Shulz Museum. The helpful friendly owners and staff of Brian’s Comics. The TARDIS and a Weeping Angel. The Angel won an award. Definitely most of the 1500+ 3000 attendees were young. Many of the folks in the dealers room were young artists, creating and distributing comics via Tumblr and the internet, some the old-school way, via paper zines. This year’s clock tower logo was drawn by a teen artist who won the logo contest. Some formerly independent writers, like Alexis E Fajardo, are seeing their work picked up by conventional publishers. Fajardo created Kid Beowulf, which uses the premise that Beowulf and Grendel were half-brothers. One thing you learn in an afternoon at LumaCon is that there are many paths to success. I love the energy of this event. The planners have scaled it exactly right; it’s one day, it’s free admission (but there are donation boxes around, and you can donate. Check out the donation page on their website.) They are aiming at the right audience — youth. (Okay, and, well, me.) They are celebrating storytelling and creativity. And they are hosting fun.
Only one Republican in the region looks like a certain winner. The rest are at some risk. Republicans enjoy nearly total dominance of the Midwest. The GOP holds every governor's office in the region, save for Minnesota, as well as every legislature except Illinois. That looks likely to change soon. The Midwest this year offers the Democratic Party its best opportunities for cutting into the Republicans' 2-to-1 advantage among governors nationwide. "The Midwest has arguably been the most competitive region in America for a very long time," says Kyle Kondik, an elections analyst at the University of Virginia. "It may be that the Midwest is swinging again." Democrats hold clear leads in the races for governor in Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota. Wisconsin Republican Gov. Scott Walker, who is seeking a third term, has been trailing in recent polls by modest but clear margins. "Walker seems to be aware this is going to be a tough year for him," says Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin. "He really has not faced an electorate that has been as hostile to his party as this electorate is going to be." The races in Iowa, Ohio and Kansas all look like tossups at this point. The only Republican in the entire Midwest who looks like a certain winner is Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts. Even in South Dakota, which hasn't elected a Democratic governor since 1974, a poll back in July showed Republican Congresswoman Kristi Noem with just a four-point edge over rancher Billie Sutton. That has kept prognosticators from writing off the Democrat's chances entirely. "After eight years of Republican governors in most of these states, voters are ready for a change," says Jared Leopold, communications director for the Democratic Governors Association. "Democrats in the Midwest are running on bread-and-butter issues, focusing on jobs and health care and education." President Trump was elected largely because he performed better in the Midwest than prior Republican candidates. He won Michigan and Wisconsin, which hadn't voted Republican since 1984, while easily carrying Ohio and Iowa, which had supported Barack Obama twice. The 206 counties that swung from Obama to Trump in 2016 were heavily concentrated in the Midwest. Iowa had the most, with 31 counties moving from the Democratic column to the Republicans'. But now Trump is a drag on Midwestern GOP hopefuls. "The bottom line is you truly have a Trump effect in Michigan," says Ed Sarpolus, a Republican pollster in the state. "Right now in Michigan, they don't like what's happening in D.C." The president's approval ratings are low around the country. In the Midwest, voters aren't happy with the effects his tariffs are having, particularly on agriculture, despite the administration's plan to subsidize farmers who have been hurt. "What's happened in China has been just an unmitigated disaster," says Lawrence Jacobs, a political scientist at the University of Minnesota. "Farmers are furious that they've lost these markets that took them decades to build, and now they're losing money." A poll released Saturday showed Democratic Iowa businessman Fred Hubbell in the lead -- albeit by a statistically insignificant two points -- over GOP Gov. Kim Reynolds. "To say it's a tossup is good for Democrats," says Dennis Goldford, a political scientist at Drake University in Des Moines. "The fact that [Reynolds] has been running negative ads in her own name suggests that they're nervous." Following in the footsteps of Terry Branstad, who was serving his sixth non-consecutive term as Iowa governor before being appointed ambassador to China last year, Reynolds still faces the challenge of how to "craft her own narrative," says Christopher Larimer, a political scientist at the University of Northern Iowa. She has emphasized her small-town Iowa roots, while seeking to paint Hubbell as an out-of-touch rich guy. "The Democrats still haven't figured out, here at least, how to penetrate these rural areas," says Goldford, the Drake professor. "They won't even listen to the Democratic message, let alone be persuaded by them." Health care has been a resonant issue elsewhere. Republican Attorneys General Bill Schuette of Michigan and Mike DeWine of Ohio, who are now their party's gubernatorial nominees, have both been critical of the Affordable Care Act. Although they have softened their stances since winning their respective primaries, Democrats are warning that they'd put their states' Medicaid expansions at risk. Neither Schuette nor DeWine has been endorsed by the outgoing GOP governor of his state (Rick Snyder in Michigan and John Kasich in Ohio). "Schuette may be perceived as a bit too conservative for the state," says Edie Goldenberg, a public policy professor at the University of Michigan. "He's taken positions that are definitely more conservative than Snyder. That's not going to help him." In the Midwest and across the country, outcomes will be determined by Democrats' ability to win over wavering suburbanites while earning a strong showing from their backers in bigger cities. "The main population centers in Minnesota, Michigan and Madison, [Wis.], these are all hotbeds of progressive fury at Trump," Jacobs says. Democrats are hoping that turnout will be stronger among their voters than has been the case in recent midterms. But an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released Sunday showed that 73 percent of seniors are interested in this year's elections, while only 35 percent of young people are. "It seems like several groups are interesting in moving younger voters," Larimer says. "In the last midterm in Iowa, their turnout was 23 percent." In short, this year's elections may shape up to be "a slightly more intense plain vanilla midterm election," Jacobs says. "You've got a president who's a bit less popular, and an opposition party that looks pretty intense." The president's party nearly always loses seats in midterms. It looks like that will translate for Democrats into more Midwestern governorships. That's certainly welcome news for the party. Given the party's weakness in the South and Mountain West, if Democrats continue to be shut out in the Midwest, their strength would be almost entirely coastal in nature. But a comeback in the gubernatorial ranks doesn't necessarily predict that they'll reverse Trump's gains in a presidential year, when the electorate will look a lot different. "The Midwest frequently swings between the parties, depending on national conditions," says the University of Virginia's Kondik. "If it does, don't assume it won't swing another way in 2020."

The catch here, is that smartphone speakers are kind of…well, rubbish. While there are a few exceptions (Sony’s Xperia phones being a notable example here), the sound usually vibrates at a resonance that makes it sound like a concert is being held inside of a tin can. Enter Sony with their SRS-XB41 Bluetooth speaker. It’s big, you can club someone to death with it and it has more bass than should be logically possible. When it comes to a heavier sound, the Sony SRS-XB41 is damn good at reproducing the funkiest of jams with an aural range of Andre the Giant’s voice pipes. If what you’re after is music reproduced with the heaviest bass possible while compromising on other sound ranges, then the Sony SRS-XB41 is for you. It’s adamant in its direction, for better or for worse, and it knows exactly what type of audio it wants to create. In case you were wondering, yes it survived an afternoon shower and a dip in the pool. You’ll get water protection of up to 30 meters depth with the SRS-XB41, with the rest of the boom tube being designed towards being a party showcase thanks to an array of LED lights dotting the face of the speaker. Hardly a dealbreaker, but kind of annoying for the pedantic DJ. It’s a nice touch, a Technicolor array of lights that pulsate nicely enough but good luck getting those blips to blink with the music. Instead, the SRS-XB41 goes at its own pace and out of sync with whatever happens to be playing. When it comes to buttons, the SRS-XB41 has a minimal setup. Less is more, and beyond the volume buttons, a power option and a mode selector at the bridge, you’ll have to dig around the bag for a rubber compartment that can be pried open to reveal a series of connections and a few more buttons embedded within. What is lovely though, is that you can activate what Sony calls Party Mode. It basically turns the speaker into a mini electronic drum kit, that can you can use to tap out percussive solos like some sort of rhythm-obsessed mechanic who likes to fix things with a hammer. It’s weird, it’s for a niche audience and it’s nice to see that Sony hasn’t lost that spark of creative madness. So how well would this speaker really work in a party situation then? I’ll tell you something: I’m pretty certainI’m partially deaf now thanks to a weekend test that I did. On the one side of an open garage, I had the SRS-XB41. On the other side? A beach buggy, that housed a throaty 1600 VW Beetle engine. My ears are still ringing, not only from the monstrous sound of a tuned engine spitting hellfire in my left ear, but also from the SRS-XB41’s full aural force assaulting my right ear with a stream of Mastadon. Hot damn, this chunky speaker is loud. I still think that sound has many various layers of quality and taste when it comes to personal preferences, but if you were looking to start a house party and drop the bass, the SRS-XB41 should have you more than covered for a modest jam session. Heck, I’ve been using this device for more than that. I’ve had it setup as a jerry-rigged PC speaker for gaming, and thanks to its astonishingly hefty battery life, I’ve managed to use it for days before it required a quick recharge. For more subtle music however, such as some good ol’ Blaze Foleyor a quick dose of Enya? I’d rather have my melody fed into my ears via a good quality headset. A bump in bass works for certain songs, certain genres, but it’s an approach that doesn’t suit every taste of music under the sun. Still, it’s hard to fault the the SRS-XB41 for its dedication. It’s like buying a Ferrari when you live in the suburbs. There’s one more feature on the SRS-XB41 that’s worth a mention at least, because if the bass is too much treble for your ears, then there is a live mode option. Honestly, it’s best to avoid this like the plague, as compared to the thumping mids of the default sound system, Live mode sounds tinny, moody and makes music sound like it was recorded in the Marianas Trench thanks to its muddy output. It may not be for everyone, but the Sony SRS-XB41 still manages to excel in the direction that it’s aimed at. It’s loud, in your face and its built to outlast an ice age.
The FCA has been in clear in its approach from the start – a balanced response allowing firms the time they need to adapt to the enormous changes of the new regulation. Way back in September 2017 Mark Steward, Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight, took pains to reassure the market that: “We intend to act proportionately. In this context, this means we will not take a strict liability approach especially given the size, complexity and magnitude of the changes that are required to be in place.” In fact, the FCA confirmed at the time that it had no intention of taking enforcement action against firms for not meeting all requirements straight away, as long as there was evidence that they had taken “sufficient steps” to meet their new obligations by the start date. Since then, the regulator has stuck to this laissez-faire approach, despite repeated warnings that it would start holding firms to account. In June 2018 FCA Chief Executive Andrew Bailey told a Treasury Select Committee that: “We have a programme of supervision that is underway and of course after a while we will enforce if people [don’t comply].” Yet in January 2019, Bailey admitted at another Treasury hearing that the FCA has yet to take enforcement action against any investment firm over MiFID II non-compliance – leading to strong criticism from the industry. Prominent wealth manager and anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller, co-founder of SCM Direct, in response called for Bailey’s resignation, claiming that he was “turning a blind eye” to fee disclosure requirements. According to SCM Direct, true transparency of costs and charges would save investors at least £903 million a year, or £4.5 billion over a five-year period, and the firm has been vocal in its criticism of the FCA for its perceived failure to take action against rule breaches. The company has already sent two dossiers of information to the FCA, in which it highlights over 50 companies it claims are in breach of MiFID II requirements; and it continues to identify and directly challenge specific firms for the non-disclosure of accurate costs and charges. In his latest Select Committee appearance Bailey defended his position, explaining that the FCA has hitherto been “focused on supervisory action”. Yet recent developments suggest that the wind could soon be changing. On February 4, 2019 the FCA revealed (in response to a Freedom of Information request from The Times newspaper) that 48 investment companies were now under investigation for failing to disclose costs – up from a total of 34 as of October 2018. And in a speech to the Tax Incentivised Savings Association last week (February 7) the FCA Head of Market Policy, Stephen Hanks, warned that just because there have not yet been any enforcement cases to date, does not mean the regulator is satisfied with current compliance levels. “We have been having discussions with firms across a range of issues which are in the nature of supervisory intervention, but as was revealed at the Treasury committee session, there are no pending enforcement cases in relation costs and charges,” he said. The FCA is expected to publish a report in Q1 2019 outlining its findings on the effectiveness of cost disclosures and the processes by which firms calculate and report transaction costs. Could these early warning signs could be viewed a primary shot across the bows? We want to hear your thoughts! Does the FCA’s easy-going approach need to upgrade into a more effective enforcement operation? Have you experienced issues with fee disclosure, or do you have a tech solution to assist firms with MiFID II disclosure requirements? Comment in the box below, or tweet us at @RegTechInsight to join the debate. I am not impressed with compliance as a whole. I founded a company and we built solutions in the knowledge the law REQUIRED that firms implement solutions. On contacting non-compliant firms, we were simply blanked, and to this day, many of them do not have solutions in place as can be seen by the publicly available data. On notifying the FCA of breaches, in an e-mail reply they simply state that it’s up to the firms concerned, and it’s nothing to do with the FCA if firms are in breach of MiFID II. Machine readable, publicly available pre and post trade transparency? Good luck with that. From all but a handful. Firms are actively and intentionally making it difficult to get this. Best execution RTS 27 & RTS 28, slightly better than transparency publication – but not by much. RTS 23 Instrument reference data from mainland continental Europe venues and SIs? Um… not really. UK firms spent millions on it, EU firms in comparison seem not to have bothered – where are the EU national regulators? RTS 25 time sync with atomic clocks or satellite networks? Nah, we’ve got our sundial, we’re fine. As someone who spent a lot of time, money and effort building solutions to the industry problems, I’d like to see the FCA grow a pair and get on with enforcement. That goes for all continental based NCAs. Firms are deliberately ignoring the regulations at the moment, as they know there are costs of complying, and no penalty for not doing so.

The Learning Network | What Have You Learned Playing Video Games? What are your favorite video games? What do you think they have taught you? Do you think video games can help inspire social change? Have you ever played one that helped you understand a serious global problem? This year, a United Nations program devoted to urban planning in countries affected by poverty or natural disasters began developing a sports field in the slums of Kibera, Kenya, designing it in the popular sandbox video game Minecraft. The game, which allows players to build entire worlds out of cubes in a 3-D environment, helped the project leaders create a visual representation of the field that could be easily understood by the neighborhood’s residents. The project, known as Block by Block, is among the highlights this week at the Games for Change Festival in New York, an annual event that promotes video games that seek social change. These efforts — known as serious games — once focused on education, to entice students to learn through digital play. But attention has shifted to more ambitious efforts like Block by Block, and a large part of that push has come from Games for Change, a nonprofit organization founded in 2004 that has worked with Google, NASA, the United Nations, the Rockefeller Foundation and TEDx. One speaker at this year’s festival is Zoran Popovic, the director of the Center for Game Science at the University of Washington, in Seattle. He led the team of researchers responsible for the puzzle game Foldit, which sought to crowdsource a solution to a scientific problem. Foldit asked players to take on the role of a biochemist and map out how proteins might be folded in nature. The game provided scores based on how well they performed. Three papers in the journal Nature have been published, based on Foldit discoveries, since the game’s release in 2008; the most famous, in 2011, explained how Foldit players had helped to decipher the structure of an AIDS-related enzyme, a problem that scientists had been trying to solve for years. Mr. Popovic plans to unveil a new project this week, a synthetic-biology game called NanoCrafter, whose goal is to discover molecular structures that could benefit vaccine and cancer research. — What are your favorite video games? What games did you play when you were younger? Looking back, what do you think they taught you — whether physical or mental skills or something more intangible? How have they enriched your life? — Have you ever played a video game like the ones at Games for Change, in which the goal is “more than entertainment”? What did you think of it? What did you learn? — Do you think video games can be effective tools for learning? Do you think playing them might actually help “change the world”? Why or why not? — If your school were to invest in a “video game for change” that was, like the examples in this article, fun to play, intellectually enriching and altruistically focused, what would you like it to be about? How might it work? Honestly I have never really played video games before, well I have but not as much as an average teen. But that little that I did play I just learned little strategies and the games really made you think. But they are really not that productive. I used to play games a lot but i have slowed down playing them now. I actually have learnt a lot of things from certain video games like strategies, and my friend said that he learnt that rubber comes from trees. I think integrating games into school could be a good idea. It would probably be executed poorly in most areas though. There’s a stigma against video games in general that label all games as bad for your brain and they make you do bad things. My favorite video game has to be guitar hero. I think this game has taught me how to multitask with my hands. I think video games are very good and can help inspire social change, depending on the type of game. No, I have never played a video game that has helped inspire me to change a serious global problem. I don’t like to play video games. I rather do something else than be in four hours play games that not be educated. the video games i have played are strategic and would make me think. i have never played a video game that benefits a cause before so i would go with some of the concepts listed in the article when deciding on one for my school to invest in. That’s actually really interesting concept because most games are like what you guys said, fps and the like. there are a handful of games that are different or promote learning. i personally have not heard anything that could help with research. My favorite video games are the grand theft auto video games. Not just because of the violence but also because I don’t play very many video games and it’s fun to just drive around and wander the game. When I was younger my favorite video game was a hand held analog stick with a few different games on it including PAC man. I don’t believe that playing these types of video games benefits you much. I’ve never played a more than entertainment goal game. But I think it’s a very intriguing idea, especially scenes so many kids learn from their surroundings and technology now days. My favorite video games are Minecraft, COD, Counterstrike Source, Guitar Hero, Farcry, and Rainbow six. Looking back at these games I have learned a little more about weaponry, and playing video games has also helped with my hand-eye corrdination. I also think playing video games can help increase your reflexes and response time. When I started playing Minecraft I immediately fell In love because it allowed me to use my creativity and build things that I’ve always wanted to build. I think video games can be a very effective tool for learning because it makes learning fun. But I also think that it should be taken in moderation and staring a screen all day isn’t that great for you and neither is sitting all day. The more interactive learning is the better it will be in general. I think that bringing video games into schools could be a good way to bring more interaction to learning. My number one game is World of tanks. when i was younger, i played minecraft. I was a 4 year minecraft player.. Minecraft gave me inspiration. But when i got World of tanks, i quit minecraft. World of tanks has taught me alot. Ive learned alot since i started playing. No blood, no gore. Just fun with big metal machines. I don’t know because I don’t play video games. Well i have not learned a lot because i don’t play a lot. It shows that there is violence in the world. Also how to help you shoot more acculturate. I think that if schools had games then more people could enjoy and relax more. I have played some games that teaches you life lessons and some games that inspires you. Video games nowadays have little education to offer for you if you are playing modern consoles. The way i learned to play video games is that most people can easily play any game if they put their mind into it. i play video games every single day and beat every single game there is its just what i like to do everyday when i get home from school etc. i can play really hard games that not everyone can beat i’m technically the best at playing horror games and war games plus games like assasins creed 1 to throughout all the other assasin creed games. i am such a video game expert i’ve played every system that ever came out from the beginning of atari to all of todays games. i just love to play video games. I love playing video games with my brothers. I play Black Ops, Mine Craft, Kinect Sports and more. Playing these games explain more than moving your thumbs it showed you how to multitask and some of the video games keeps you physically active when you have a X-Box 360. Im a senior in High School. Im always playing video games whenever im not either at school, work, or golf. I love video games and I feel that they are a quintessential part of learning. I have played almost every game. Games like pokemon help you to solve problems. Games like portal cause you to use physics and puzzles to play the game. Games like the bioshock series or the half life series create stories, that in my opinion, are better than reading book because you get to experience it. Even games like Call of duty increases reflexes. – My favourite video games are Deus Ex, The Witcher 2 and Half-Life 2. As someone who lives in germany, where most students don’t speak english very good. I think video games taught me a lot about english. It was the only subject I NEVER had problems with. From the first day on I was too good for my grade. – I honestly have never played one of those games, but after this article I’m definitely looking forward to them. – I don’t know, maybe about subjects, that are boring and complicated for many students, like biology and chemistry? I personally wouldn’t be able to come up with an idea, but smart people, probably would. I play a lot of RPGs mostly. They are some of my favorite games. Most RPGs give you choices, and what choices you make affects the people, and world around you. Usually the choices range from good, to neutral, to evil. This is very similar to how life really is. The choices we make, whether they are good or bad, have a bigger impact on the world around us than we may think. my favorite video games are games like Portal and Persona, games that actually require thinking while playing and not just mindless button mashing, the thing i think they’ve taught me… that no matter who you are you can always be a hero if you put your mind to it! Unfortunately not, i would love to have the chance to be able to though, i believe that video games are more than just a way to distract ourselves or have a good time, i believe that the educational value of video games are much greater than what people believe. Yes, video games are tools, whether the tool is used for entertainment or for education, it’s full potential cannot be realized unless someone steps forward and says “lets try to use it like this!” and works hard on that. I would like that many possibilities for interactive learning would open up, these interactive lessons would not only increase the amount of fun in a classroom, but also the amount of passion from students who can honestly say that the lessons spoke to them. @Alondra The correct sentence would be: I don’t like to play video games. I Would rather do something else than playing four hours of video games that do not help with my education. I have played video games for years. All to often my choices were challenged or denied by my parents. At first I couldn’t comprehend the difference or what were the deciding factors for their answer. As I’ve grown older I see know how video games have the power to shape one’s personality. Even in video games there are choices to be made, altruistic choices that can benefit another individual in the game or choices to eliminate your opponent. The choices are made in real life all to often and it’s vital that children and teenagers recognized the value or consequences of the choices even within the games. I am impressed by the idea of Games for Change. If our school were to invest in such a game perhaps one that affords students the opportunity to understand how closely connected their games choices are to real life. A game that teaches altruistic behavior and choices while still having fun. We find a significant change and positive growth in our society through future generations. The focus of the some games is to build what ever the mind can imagine. I think that games can be more than entertainment because it makes you think about things that you may have see in your life. It also could make you think of real building and structure around the world. Others games can make you think about real life world problems and make you aware that they are happening. They may also help influence what you do later in your life. Overall I think that some games can do more than just entertainment and can make you think about real things and ideas.
During LeBron James’ back-to-back championship winning tenure in Miami, rival Joakim Noah famously referred to King James and the Heat as “Hollywood as hell.” Over the summer, James fully embraced his inner producer by relocating to Los Angeles and jump-starting the Spurs-Lakers rivalry that had remained dormant since 2013. After a string of untimely backcourt injuries during the preseason, NBA pundits are predicting that San Antonio’s 21-season playoff streak is likely at its end, with James and his “Meme Team” among the squads supplanting the Spurs in the pre-season. Although neither team is projected to be hoisting the Larry O’Brien trophy in June, Spurs vs. Lakers still presents some intriguing matchups. Besides, anytime Michael Beasly, JaVale McGee and Lance Stephenson are on the court at the same time, expect the unexpected. $22-$398, Sat Oct. 27, 7:30pm, AT&T Center, One AT&T Center Pkwy., (210) 444-5000, attcenter.com.
As usual, Professor Jack Ponton (Letters, 8 July) cuts through all the smoke and mirrors erected by the renewables industries to give the facts. He points out the absurdity of the regular and monotonous claims from the wind industry that at certain times they providing enough electricity to power umpteen million homes. Until there is a research breakthrough in battery storage, wind-generated electricity will continue to be an expensive failed science which only benefits the developers and land owners. I am reminded of a former MSP who berated me on my anti-wind stance, stating that the wind produced at night was more than required during the day and was not wasted but stored in batteries. I asked her where this scientific breakthrough was located. Silence. I suspect that many of our present politicians are equally ignorant and are unaware of the risks that renewables pose to our energy security, especially with their anti-fossil fuels fixation. Do they appreciate that Longannet is due to close soon, followed by nuclear?

Since Ben Affleck was shut out of a Best Director nomination at the Oscars, the awards tide has seemed to turn away from “Lincoln” and back towards the earliest front runner “Argo” with both Affleck and the film itself picking up numerous awards since. This weekend though it nabbed one of the biggest – the top feature film honor, the Darryl F. Zanuck Award, at the 24th Annual Producers Guild of America Awards. In other categories, “Wreck-It Ralph” won for best animated feature, while “Searching for Sugar Man” took best documentary. On the TV side, “Homeland” won best drama series, “Modern Family” best comedy series, and “Game Change” best TV Movie/Mini-Series.

You might not be able to live out the rest of your days with Pride and Prejudice’s fictional Mr. Darcy, but you can spend them at his British estate. The estate will serve as the perfect muse for all that Pride and Prejudice fan fiction you’ve been dying to write. The estate, which has five miles worth of corridors, was home to the fourth Earl Fitzwilliam, who reportedly inspired Darcy himself. While $10.9 million might seem like a bargain, keep in mind that there is an estimated $65.6 million of required repairs.
The personal squabbling over the career of a ballet prodigy continued Monday when the mother of 15-year-old Misty Copeland dropped a request for a temporary restraining order against the girl's two instructors, but said she still wanted the couple to stay away from her daughter. Also complicating Misty's future were emancipation proceedings she had initiated against her mother, Sylvia DelaCerna. Monday, Torrance Superior Court Judge Lois Anderson Smaltz said the girl had told her she wanted to discontinue them. The Los Angeles dance community is watching the machinations closely. Misty won a prestigious Spotlight Award in ballet as the best young dancer in Los Angeles this year despite less than three years of dance experience. The victory caught the attention of professional dance companies, including the famed Joffrey Ballet. After meeting with attorneys in her chambers for nearly 45 minutes, the judge dismissed DelaCerna's motion for separate restraining orders against dance instructors Patrick and Cynthia Bradley as well as against the Los Angeles attorney who filed the emancipation case on Misty's behalf. DelaCerna had filed for the restraining orders because she said the Bradleys, who had taken Misty into their home for more than two years for dance training, had brainwashed her daughter into filing for her legal freedom. She alleged that they had only financial motives in mind. Monday's developments appeared to have had little effect on the tense custody standoff. Speaking before more than a dozen news cameras and reporters outside the courthouse following the judge's ruling, DelaCerna's attorney, Gloria Allred, said she expected the Bradleys to honor a sworn promise made in court declarations that they only wanted what was best for Misty and would "abide by any decision the family makes." "After a great deal of thought, Misty's mother has determined that it will be in Misty's best interest not to have any further contact with Cynthia and Patrick Bradley," Allred said. Earlier, the Bradleys told reporters that they still had a personal management contract with Misty--an agreement signed by the dancer's mother--that gave them exclusive rights to manage her career, as well as a 20% cut of her earnings, minus expenses, until her 18th birthday. "Our contract is still in full bloom," Cynthia Bradley said. "We hope to continue to manage Misty's career and be her teachers. Eventually, we hope to see her on every stage around the world." When asked about the contract, Allred said, "We believe that contract is voidable. We don't believe it's enforceable and we won't be honoring it." In dismissing the motions, Smaltz said the case revolved around "individual rights that emphasize personal success over the family unit or family togetherness." She said it was Misty's desire to live with her mother and not pursue emancipation. Smaltz added that in a closed-door meeting last week, Misty told her she wanted the parties to sit down privately and resolve their differences over her career. But DelaCerna said Monday that wouldn't be happening. Reading from a statement, she said, "I love my daughter immensely and will continue to support her in her dance career," adding that Misty will continue taking lessons at a Torrance dance school, away from the Bradleys. Misty also recited from a brief statement, saying, "I am happy that this is over and I can continue with my dancing." But in answer to reporters' questions, she seemed less sure of her words. "I've always wanted everyone to get along," she said.

In April 2017, a fire broke out in UW-Milwaukee’s Peck School of the Arts’ Mainstage Theatre causing significant damage to the theater seats, scene shop, backstage space, and lighting system. Clearwing Systems Integration was contracted to reconstruct the rigging and lighting systems, renewing just a portion of the $5.7 million of damage throughout the building. The rigging system in UWM’s Mainstage space was original to the building with authentic and vintage parts from when the space first opened over 50 years ago. The install included counterweight linesets for moving scenery up and down over the stage, masking curtains to block the audience’s view of backstage, and a grand drape to complement the theater decor. These updates provide a new sense of comfort and security in the educational space. Rigging components were provided by H&H Specialties, a distinguished national supplier of stage rigging equipment; drapes by Bellatex, a leading manufacturer in stage drapery; and a fire safety curtain by Thermotex, designed to contain fire and provide separation between audience and stage in the case of a fire in the future. The lighting portion consists of new dimmers, house lights, architectural control, and system networking by Electronic Theatre Control out of Middleton, WI. The new system is capable of controlling both older-style incandescent stage fixtures, as well as new technology like LEDs, moving lights, and effects projectors. Because it is based on network infrastructure, the lighting control is flexible and allows for expandability as the needs of the University and its productions change over time.
Massachusetts tenants who have experienced a hard time getting back their security deposit even after sending a request letter to the landlord need to send this Security Deposit Demand letter. The state laws in Massachusetts clearly states that the landlord can make deduction only to cover unpaid rent costs and damages beyond typical wear and tear of which they must provide an itemized list with receipts as proof. The statutory time for returning the tenant’s security deposit is 30 days and beyond that, it is considered unlawful and in “bad faith”. The tenant has the right to go to court and file a case against the landlord for wrongfully withholding their security deposit. Pursuant to the laws of Massachusetts, landlords defaulting to pay back the owed security deposit in time risk paying treble damages on the withheld amount if the matter ends up in court. This Security Deposit Demand letter warns the landlord that they stand to face tough consequences and also reminds them that it is in their best interest to settle the matter out of court. Filing a lawsuit can take a lot of time, but simply downloading this letter, filling it and sending it to the landlord is a simple, yet effective process that can be done in minutes. Usually, a professionally written security deposit demand letter is all that one needs to get back the owed security deposit. Any correspondence or agreement you reach with the landlord should always be in written form to have proof if the conflicts ends in court. Be sure to make your own copy of this letter and send it via certified post to get a return receipt . Our letters for Massachusetts renters are tailored to your state, with the right laws to get your landlord’s attention.

In organisations around the world employees are accidently merging their personal and professional cloud applications with dire results. Some of the issues include the routing of sensitive text messages to family members and the replication of confidential documents onto the servers of competitors. Our personal and work lives are merging. When done well, this can be a huge boost to our productivity and personal satisfaction. The rise of the smart mobile device has been a major part of this merge, driving Chief Information Officers towards various flavours of Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policies. With the advent of a myriad of cloud services delivered over the internet, our individual cloud architectures are becoming far more complex. The increasing trend to move beyond BYOD to Bring Your Own Application (BYOA) means that the way individuals configure their own personal technology has the potential to directly impact their employer. In this environment, one employee could be swapped out for another easily and all were prepared to conform to a defined way of working. Our offices were perhaps best compared to Henry Ford’s production line of the early twentieth century where productivity required conformity. It’s no wonder that IT has put such a high value on a Standard Operating Environment. However, new styles of working have taken hold (see Your insight might protect your job). Businesses and government are employing more experts on a shared basis. An increasing proportion of the workforce is best described as being made up of “knowledge workers” and a sizeable number of these people are choosing to work in new ways including spreading their week over several organisations. Even fulltime staff find that that their employers have entered into complex joint ventures meaning that the definition of the enterprise is constantly shifting. Personal productivity is complex and highly dependent on the individual. The approach that works for one person is a complete anathema for another. Telling people to work in a standard way is like adding a straightjacket to their productivity. Employees should be allowed to use their favourite tools to schedule their time, author documents, create presentations and take notes. Not only is the workplace is moving away from lowest common denominator software, the increasing integration between mobile, tablet and personal computers means that the boundaries between them are becoming less clear. It all adds up to the end of the Standard Operating Environment. CIOs are right to worry that BYOD and BYOA will result in their data being spread out over an unmanageable number of systems and platforms. It is no longer workable to simply demand that all information be kept in a single source of truth physical database or repository. I’ve previously argued that the foundation of a proper strategy is to separate the information from the business logic or processes that create it (see Your data is in the cloud when…). Some of the simplest approaches that CIOs have taken to manage their BYOD environment have involved virtualisation solutions where a virtual desktop with the Standard Operating Environment is run over a client which is available on many devices. While this is progress, it barely touches the productivity question. While workers can choose the form factor of the device that suits them, they are still being forced into the straightjacket of lowest common denominator business applications. The vendors are going to continue to provide better solutions which put the data in a standard form while allowing access to many (even competing) applications. It’s not about just one copy of the data on a database, but rather allowing controlled replication and digital watermarks that track the movement of this data including loss prevention. For example, organisations constantly struggle with managing their staff master data, but in a world of personal social media employees will effectively identify themselves (see Login with social media). Managing software licenses, even in the most efficient organisation, is still an imperfect science at best with little motivation for users to optimise their portfolio. When employees can bring their own cloud subscriptions to work, with an agreed allowance paid to them, the choices that they make are so much more tailored to their actual needs today rather than what they might need in months or even years to come. Organisations that have grappled with provisioning new PCs are seeing the advantages of the consumer app stores with employees self-administering deployment between devices. Cloud and hardware providers are increasingly recognising the complex nature of families and are enabling security and deployment of content between members. The good news is that even the simplest family structure is more complicated than almost any enterprise organisation chart! We see a hint of bad architecture when staff misconfigure their iPhones and end-up with their (potentially sensitive) text messages being shared with their spouse or wider family or when contractors use their personal cloud drive working across more than one organisation. Even worse is when it goes really wrong and a ransomware breach on a personal computer infects all of these shared resources! The breadth of services that the personal cloud covers is constantly growing. For many, it already includes their telecommunications, voicemail, data storage, diary, expense management, timesheets, authoring of office documents, messaging (email and texts), professional library, project management, diagram tools and analytics. Architecture is even beginning to matter in social media with the convergence of the tools most of us use (see The future of social networks). Some employers fear the trend of cloud, BYOD and BYOA will lead to the loss of their organisation’s IP. The smart enterprise, however, is realising that well-managed cloud architectures and appropriate taxonomies can help rather than hinder employees to know what’s theirs and what’s yours. In the near future you may even start choosing staff based on the quality of their personal cloud architecture!
What Service Mesh Architecture Should I Pick? If you are building your software and teams around microservices, you’re looking for ways to iterate faster and scale flexibly. A service mesh can help you do that while maintaining (or enhancing) visibility and control. In this blog, I’ll talk about what’s actually in a Service Mesh and what considerations you might want to make when choosing and deploying one. Looking at that list, you may think “I can do all of that without a Service Mesh”, and you’re correct. The same logic applies to sliding window protocols or request framing. But once there’s an emerging standard that does what you want, it’s more efficient to rely on that layer instead of implementing it yourself. Service Mesh is that emerging layer for microservices patterns. Service mesh is still nascent enough that codified standards have yet to emerge, but there is enough experience that some best practices are beginning to become clear. As the the bleeding-edge leaders develop their own approaches, it is often useful to compare notes and distill best practices. We’ve seen Kubernetes emerge as the standard way to run containers for production web applications. My favorite standards are emergent rather than forced: It’s definitely a fine art to be neither too early nor too late to agree on common APIs, protocols and concepts. Think about the history of computer networking. After the innovation of best-effort packet-switched networks, we found out that many of us were creating virtual circuits over them – using handshaking, retransmission and internetworking to turn a pile of packets into an ordered stream of bytes. For the sake of interoperability and simplicity, a “best practice” stream-over-packets emerged: TCP (the Introduction of RFC675 does a good job of explaining what it layers on top of). There are alternatives – I’ve used the Licklider Transmission Protocol in space networks where distributed congestion control is neither necessary nor efficient. Your browser might already be using QUIC. Standardizing on TCP, however, freed a generation of programmers from fiddling with implementations of sliding windows, retries, and congestion collapse (well, except for those packetheads that implemented it). Next, we found a lot of request/response protocols running on top of TCP. Many of these eventually migrated to HTTP (or sequels like HTTP/2 or gRPC). If you can factor your communication into “method, metadata, body”, you should be looking at an HTTP-like protocol to manage framing, separate metadata from body, and address head-of-line blocking. This extends beyond just browser apps – databases like Mongo provide HTTP interfaces because the ubiquity of HTTP unlocks a huge amount of tooling and developer knowledge. You can think about service mesh as being the lexicon, API and implementation around the next tier of communication patterns for microservices. In a Library that your microservices applications import and use. In a Node Agent or daemon that services all of the containers on a particular node/machine. In a Sidecar container that runs alongside your application container. The library approach is the original. It is simple and straightforward. In this case, each microservice application includes library code that implements service mesh features. Libraries like Hystrix and Ribbon would be examples of this approach. This works well for apps that are exclusively written in one language by the teams that run them (so that it’s easy to insert the libraries). The library approach also doesn’t require much cooperation from the underlying infrastructure – the container runner (like Kubernetes) doesn’t need to be aware that you’re running a Hystrix-enhanced app. There is some work on multilanguage libraries (reimplementations of the same concepts). The challenge here is the complexity and effort involved in replicating the same behavior over and over again. We see very limited adoption of the library model in our user base because most of our users are running applications written in many different languages (polyglot), and are also running at least a few applications that aren’t written by them so injecting libraries isn’t feasible. This model has an advantage in work accounting: the code performing work on behalf of the microservice is actually running in that microservice. The trust boundary is also small – you only have to trust calling a library in your own process, not necessarily a remote service somewhere out over the network. That code only has as many privileges as the one microservice it is performing work on behalf of. That work is also performed in the context of the microservice, so it’s easy to fairly allocate resources like CPU time or memory for that work – the OS probably does it for you. The node agent model is the next alternative. In this architecture, there’s a separate agent (often a userspace process) running on every node, servicing a heterogenous mix of workloads. For purposes of our comparison, it’s the opposite of the library model: it doesn’t care about the language of your application but it serves many different microservice tenants. Linkerd’s recommended deployment in Kubernetes works like this. As do F5’s Application Service Proxy (ASP) and the Kubernetes default kube-proxy. Since you need one node agent on every node, this deployment requires some cooperation from the infrastructure – this model doesn’t work without a bit of coordination. By analogy, most applications can’t just choose their own TCP stack, guess an ephemeral port number, and send or receive TCP packets directly – they delegate that to the infrastructure (operating system). Instead of good work accounting, this model emphasizes work resource sharing – if a node agent allocates some memory to buffer data for my microservice, it might turn around and use that buffer for data for your service in a few seconds. This can be very efficient, but there’s an avenue for abuse. If my microservice asks for all the buffer space, the node agent needs to make sure it gives your microservice a shot at buffer space first. You need a bit more code to manage this for each shared resource. Another work resource that benefits from sharing is configuration information. It’s cheaper to distribute one copy of the configuration to each node, than to distribute one copy of the configuration to each pod on each node. A lot of functionality that containerized microservices rely on are provided by a Node Agent or something topologically equivalent. Think about kubelet initializing your pod, your favorite CNI daemon like flanneld, or stretching your brain a bit, even the operating system kernel itself as following this node agent model. Sidecar is the new kid on the block. This is the model used by Istio with Envoy. Conduit also uses a sidecar approach. In Sidecar deployments, you have one adjacent container deployed for every application container. For a service mesh, the sidecar handles all the network traffic in and out of the application container. This approach is in between the library and node agent approaches for many of the tradeoffs I discussed so far. For instance, you can deploy a sidecar service mesh without having to run a new agent on every node (so you don’t need infrastructure-wide cooperation to deploy that shared agent), but you’ll be running multiple copies of an identical sidecar. Another take on this: I can install one service mesh for a group of microservices, and you could install a different one, and (with some implementation-specific caveats) we don’t have to coordinate. This is powerful in the early days of service mesh, where you and I might share the same Kubernetes cluster but have different goals, require different feature sets, or have different tolerances for bleeding-edge vs. tried-and-true. Sidecar is advantageous for work accounting, especially in some security-related aspects. Here’s an example: suppose I’m using a service mesh to provide zero-trust style security. I want the service mesh to verify both ends (client and server) of a connection cryptographically. Let’s first consider using a node agent: When my pod wants to be the client of another server pod, the node agent is going to authenticate on behalf of my pod. The node agent is also serving other pods, so it must be careful that another pod cannot trick it into authenticating on my pod’s behalf. If we think about the sidecar case, my pod’s sidecar does not serve other pods. We can follow the principle of least privilege and give it the bare minimum it needs for the one pod it is serving in terms of authentication keys, memory and network capabilities. So, from the outside the sidecar has the same privileges as the app it is attached to. On the other hand, the sidecar needs to intervene between the app and the outside. This creates some security tension: you want the sidecar to have as little privilege as possible, but you need to give it enough privilege to control traffic to/from the app. For example, in Istio, the init container responsible for setting up the sidecar has the NET_ADMIN permission currently (to set up the iptables rules necessary). That initialization uses good security practices – it does the minimum amount necessary and then goes away, but everything with NET_ADMIN represents attack surface. (Good news – smart people are working on enhancing thisfurther). Once the sidecar is attached to the app, it’s very proximate from a security perspective. Not as close as a function call in your process (like library) but usually closer than calling out to a multi-tenant node agent. When using Istio in Kubernetes your app container talks to the sidecar over a loopback interface inside of the network namespace shared with your pod – so other pods and node agents generally can’t see that communication. Most Kubernetes clusters have more than one pod per node (and therefore more than one sidecar per node). If each sidecar needs to know “the entire config” (whatever that means for your context), then you’ll need more bandwidth to distribute that config (and more memory to store copies of it). So it can be powerful to limit the scope of configuration that you have to give to each sidecar – but again there’s an opposing tension: something (in Istio’s case, Pilot) has to spend more effort computing that reduced configuration for each sidecar. Other things that happen to be replicated across sidecars accrue a similar bill. Good news – the container runtimes will reuse things like container disk images when they’re identical and you’re using the right drivers, so the disk penalty is not especially significant in many cases, and memory like code pages can also often be shared. But each sidecar’s process-specific memory will be unique to that sidecar so it’s important to keep this under control and avoid making your sidecar “heavy weight” by doing a bunch of replicated work in each sidecar. Service Meshes relying on sidecar provide a good balance between a full set of features, and a lightweight footprint. Will the node agent or sidecar model prevail? I think you’re likely to see some of both. Now seems like a perfect time for sidecar service mesh: nascent technology, fast iteration and gradual adoption. As service mesh matures and the rate-of-change decreases, we’ll see more applications of the node agent model. As Shawn talked about in his post, we’ve been thinking about how microservices change the requirements from network infrastructure for a few years now. The swell of support and uptake for Istio demonstrated to us that there’s a community ready to develop and coalesce on policy specs, with a well-architected implementation to go along with it. Istio is advancing state-of-the-art microservices communication, and we’re excited to help make that technology easy to operate, reliable, and well-suited for your team’s workflow in private cloud, public cloud or hybrid. So just to clarify: in the sidecar approach you’d usually (always?) implement the sidecar in it’s own container, where that container is “paired” with a given application’s container. But how does that relate to pods? I.e. to what extent are applications typically arranged into a single container vs two or more? If I have an application that is arranged across two or more containers (in the same pod) how many sidecars would you have? Therefore, is the notion of a sidecar specifically one that is at the application specific, container specific, or a pod specific? Great question and one that we could have done a better job of being clear on in the post. It is a sidecar for every pod. You can run the sidecar inside the same container as the service itself. It’s docker religion that you should only run one user process in a container, but there’s no practical justification for it in the context of a service and its sidecar. The recommendation refers to separate, independent processes that provide different services, and need to be allowed to fail and evolve separately. You don’t want this with a service and its sidecar. Between those two you want the closest runtime coupling that can be – they should always live and die together. Which is what putting them in the same container helps achieving for cheap. When deployed into separate containers, you need to rely on the orchestration tool to ensure this. Running the sidecar and the service inside the same container also reduces runtime overhead in terms of resources and latency (inter-container communication is cheap, when the containers run on the same host, but communication inside the container is even cheaper, and deploying half the number of containers, even with higher memory allocation, significantly increases deployment density). Running the sidecar in the same container as the service is an even closer coupling than as a second container in the same kubernetes pod. When the sidecar is a separate container in the same pod, it has at least a few defenses against bad behavior from the service. The sidecar can bring along its own filesystem, and gets its own process namespace. This allows for instance the sidecar to have certs & keys that are not available to the service. This is helpful if you want to rely on the sidecar; for example, you might trust the sidecar to apply a policy. Other services can trust that requests signed by the sidecar did have the policy enforced. On the other hand, if you view the sidecar as really just a friendly application enhancer and not a strong policy enforcer, then it’s convenient to run the sidecar in the same container. My experience with Kubernetes has been that it’s good at killing pods even if only one of the containers dies. It’s definitely possible to make or run your own container init system so you can run multiple processes and die if any die, but so far I haven’t found the need. I’m not sure what you mean by “communication inside the container is even cheaper.” In Kubernetes, two containers in a pod share a network namespace, so communicating over localhost is the same whether two containers in a pod or two processes in a container. Are you thinking about using shared memory or shared filesystems? Does deploying half the number of containers (but with each container being “twice” as big) actually increase deployment density significantly? In that case, it’s still the same amount of filesystem disk bytes, running the same processes, just with some extra namespace boundaries between them. I’d love to know more about this.
The few hours between dinner and bedtime should be the most relaxing part of the day, but too often we spend them thinking about what we will accomplish tomorrow. I propose a nightly ritual to help us forget our troubles and really let go: the nightcap. Some might consider the nightcap a lost art, but with a few tricks anyone can master it. There are only a few rules: no cocktails, no beer, and no scary stories (they might cause bad dreams). Although many good nightcaps are high-alcohol, the point isn’t to become intoxicated. A nightcap is something to sip slowly. Enjoy the warming effects of a nice spirit while conversing with someone you care about. If you have a fireplace you should definitely sit by it. If you don’t, then consider playing a fireplace video on your laptop. Slippers and silk robes are optional; relaxation is mandatory. Cognac is perhaps the most traditional nightcap. To be called Cognac a spirit must be distilled from grapes in the Cognac region of France. This bottle has wonderful floral and nutty flavors and will certainly help you forget about that coworker who won’t clean the fridge. Armagnac is distilled through a process similar to Cognac, but comes from the Armagnac region. This example is full of warm spices like clove and cinnamon. One sip and it won’t matter that you found a scratch on your car this morning. Are you out of milk? It doesn’t matter; you can grocery shop tomorrow. Just enjoy this beautiful brandy for now. This California bottle is full of caramel and pear flavors. Put your feet up. This Calvados is distilled from 100 percent apples. You’ll feel like you’re sitting in an orchard. This Pommeau de Normandie is a hard cider that has been fortified with apple brandy. The result is slightly sweet, apple-y, and full of baking spices. Try pairing this with a blanket and a good friend. This bourbon is distilled in Brooklyn. It’s toasty, spicy, and complex enough to distract you from whatever is on TV. This 10-year Scotch from Ardbeg is peaty, but not overwhelmingly so. It also has plenty of bright citrusy flavors. Pour a dram and lounge around in a mahogany den. Many people associate rum with lounging poolside, icy drinks, and cocktail umbrellas, but it can be so much more. Try a small tumbler of this creamy, fruity Barbados-style rum neat and you’ll be instantly at ease. This isn’t your grandmother’s cream sherry. Hidalgo is an oloroso sherry that’s quite dry, with plenty of fig and caramel flavors. Try a small glass to ward off nightmares. This Madeira is perfect for those who have a bit of a sweet tooth. It’s complex and luxurious and the perfect accompaniment to a tranquil night in. It’s unusual to find a dry anise-flavored liqueur, but this one is lovely. If you like herbal flavors and black licorice then this is for you. It won’t matter if the forecast for tomorrow says rain. Grab a friend or lover, cozy up, and try one of these nightcaps to put yourself at ease before bed. By day, Madeline manages the video program at Astor Wines and Spirits and Astor Center. At night, she can be found biking around Brooklyn, seeking out new dumplings in Chinatown, or experimenting in her tiny kitchen in Clinton Hill.

A singer and her two daughters have a tense reunion after years. An idealistic lawyer wants to help the poor get justice, but lacks finance, so plans to rob a bank, alongside his love interest. His black n white emotional nature, leads to an unforgivable deed, which he severely repents. The Bollywood fare is burning brighter with each film. When an actor the like Arjun Rampal(Salim) is thrown with the likes of Shabana Azmi(Rukshana Anwar)and Urmila Matondkar, some of the talent has to rub off on him and it does in this marvelous movie called "Tehzeeb"(Etiquette). Even though it is difficult to accept them in the role of a mother and daughter the acting prowess of Shabana Azmi takes a notch over Urmila and both come out as top notch talent at the end, where as the other two characters have a long road ahead. Except the song that Shabana sings for her daughter, the music of AR Rahman is a flop to think he may be an overworked composer. The standout is ace direction, Screenplay and Cinematography.There is not much dowdt that Urmilla Matondkar has immense talent that very few of her contemporaries can match. Suffice to say this a a beautifully enacted film that lingers long after the movie including the very short and impressive perf. by Rishi Kapoor.
It's snow sport season. Yeah! Lets get together and refresh our avalache knowledge and do some transceiver exercises. It's promising to be a big snow year (dare I say it). The location is to be determined but probably in the TA/Chama area. I'm looking at locatons with enough snow to make it interesting, where we can play with our gear not far from the car, and then do something fun (it's all fun to me). If you have a suggestion please profer it. Los Alamos participants will rally at LANB at 7:15 departing nlt than 7:30. This hike is in the valley, near Hernandez north of Espanola. The drive will be about 40 minutes each way. I estimate the length of the hike as 10-12 miles. Some scrambling and bushwhacking could be involved. I have never been to this location, so be prepared for some uncertainty along the way. Some interesting geological features (dikes) are expected. Do you want to spend time outside on Black Friday instead of in stores? REI's #OptOutside campaign inspired us to provide this guided hike to help you enjoy the outdoors. Opt to spend the day outside, enjoying nature, rather than fighting the crowds or staring at a screen. The location for this hike will be determined at a later date, once we know the snow situation and trail conditions. Plan on a moderately difficult hike that will take about 4 hours. The group will stop around noon to enjoy lunch on the trail. Let's start the day with a little hike right here in town. I expect the hike to take about an hour and a half, and will take a route through a shallow canyon without an established trail. We'll begin at 8:00 on Thansgiving day. We have an extra bedroom in a house we rented in Pagosa, and are looking for someone who would like to join in on some Wolf Creek skiing. Decent base up there, and as they say,they have the best snow in Colorado. We will drive up to Pagosa Thursday afternoon/evening after turkey, ski Friday and Saturday at Wolf Creek, and drive home after Saturday's skiing. The cost for a bedroom for the two nights is about $150. The house can be seen at https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/18785650. Let me know as soon as you can if you would like to join us. I would like to announce the tenth edition of our very successful trips to Moab. We have been going most Novembers since 2008, and every time has been a great success. The 2014 trip report can be found at http://lamountaineers.org/node/479#comment-57. Do you know what to do when someone is hurt, sick, or lost in the outdoors? This two-day SOLO Wilderness First Aid (WFA) course will cover the basics of how to help someone in need of first aid. It will help you know what to do in a variety of scenarios and accidents. This is a great opportunity for outdoor enthusiasts, trip leaders, or people who spend time in remote, rural, or disaster-prone areas. The class will meet both Saturday and Sunday, November 3 and 4, from 8 AM to 5 PM, at PEEC 2600 Canyon Road, Los Alamos.
A Netherlands public agency responsible for providing social benefits was struggling to create an efficient system for detecting fraud in applications to receive social benefits. Only a very small fraction of the applications that were flagged by the system for possible fraud turned out to be actual fraud; in fact, the great majority was “false positives.” The need to investigate such a large number of false positives was overwhelming the agency’s capacity to review cases and root out real cases of deceit. Deloitte Netherlands invited the agency to visit the Greenhouse for a demonstration of how advanced analytics could be used to detect fraud more reliably. The solution that Deloitte Netherlands’ analytics specialists had in mind was a “machine learning” program: one that would teach itself to flag benefits applications for possible fraud and use feedback from the fraud team’s analysis to gain accuracy over time. Ahead of the Greenhouse session, Deloitte Netherlands received samples of the client’s actual benefits application records, some fraudulent and some legitimate. Working closely with the client’s software vendor, Deloitte Netherlands’ analytics team created a model to scan the records and devise a logical method of identifying applications that appeared fraudulent. That model would be put to the test in the Greenhouse. Deloitte Netherlands began the Greenhouse session by explaining how machine learning works; in this case they showed how a computer learns to judge whether a head photographed from behind belongs to a man or a woman. The machine-learning model uses a “training” sample of photographs—photos identified as men or women—to create a formula for predicting gender based on a weighted combination of visual attributes such as hair length and neck size. Every successive training case enabled the model to gain prediction accuracy by changing the importance it assigns to each attribute. Next, the team ran the fraud-detection model it had created for the client. The team fed a batch of application records into the model. Like the photographic-prediction model, the fraud-detection model became increasingly accurate as it churned through the new batch of records and refined its logic for making fraud predictions based on each record’s attributes. By the end of the session, the model was operating at approximately 75 percent prediction accuracy—a big improvement over the client’s existing accuracy rate. The Greenhouse session provided the agency with a firsthand look at how predictive analytics really works. It was also the first time the agency had seen advanced analytics applied to their work, and it convinced them to proceed with implementing the predictive model that Deloitte Netherlands had showcased in the Greenhouse. The model was eventually flagging fraudulent applications with 95 percent accuracy. The model not only increased the efficiency of the fraud department, but also stopped a large number of fraudulent payments. Further analysis of the predicted and validated fraud cases also revealed valuable insight into fraud patterns.
The Kings of LAN 2018 concluded successfully on Sunday, 24th June and with it we are proud to announce that Noob Alliance is tied for first place with Phoenix Gaming. After a tense battle between multiple gaming titles, our players were able to clutch out a series of victories that went the distance. We saw a dominant performance from our existing members and some amazing plays from our newly recruited members who showed why they are a force to be reckoned with. Team Reconnected made their debut game for Noob Alliance at KOL 2018 and with it they have solidified their standing in the domestic scene for SF2. Team Reconnected had an amazing performance throughout the bracket, beating noticeable teams such as Pnx.Heroes and Team Maximum. Reconnected secured second place with relative ease and we expect them to dominate SF2 coming forward. Team Dark Knights had a stellar run in the tournament, after being recruited this year Dark Knights show continuous improvement and development in their play and we expect nothing less, Dark Knights secured 4th place after the conclusion of the SF2 Bracket. Noob Alliance made their entry into Tekken back in SLCG 2017 and with the recruitment of Ashen “Blazer” Samarawickrama we have been a dominant power in Sri Lankan Tekken. Blazer showed monumental plays and clutched out fight after fight. Blazer successfully obtained second place after falling in the final, rest assured we will be back with a vengeance. Noob Alliance hosts the largest standing Clash Royale roster in Sri Lanka with players across the top ranks in the leader board. We are proud to announce that Noob Alliance obtained the 1st, 2nd and 3rd place at the CR Bracket, thus making a strong statement to our opponents. nA.Daniel, continued his reign of terror by taking out his opposition at early brackets and went against his fellow nA players. Daniel managed to pull out yet another tournament victory after just coming back from the Asian Games. nA Hanif, showed his skills across the brackets yet again beating out any other opponents and going head to head with his teammate nA.Daniel. After an intense game Hanif managed to secure second place. Honourable mentions go to nA Parthi and nA RNB, with Parthi securing third place after an excellent early bracket game, meeting nA.RNB for the bronze match and after a very interesting matchup, nA.Pathi secured 3rd place while nA.RNB obtained 4th place. The Clash Royale wing of Noob Alliance continues to dominate Sri Lanka with a convincing fashion. Noob Alliance continues it’s interest into developing its FIFA Wing, with longstanding members such as nA.Venom, nA.Shark and nA.SadirOmer who continue to prove their depth of experience and skill in the game. nA.Venom has proven why he is considered the best player in Sri Lankan FIFA, he absolutely dominated the starting brackets by going against fierce opponents from Phoenix Gaming and Tech Morph. nA.Venom swept the finals 2-0 and securing the first place with ease. Noticeable mentions go to nA.Shark and nA.SadirOmer who had an excellent run in the early brackets. The FIFA Wing will look forward to improvement and further development to maintain its dominant position. Noob Alliance has made a huge impact at this annual Kings of LAN and with this momentum we look to move forward to the next upcoming ranked tournament which is the “SLT LAN Challenge”; expect Noob Alliance to be there with a fury.
(JACKSON, Miss.) – Producer, director and actor Spike Lee will appear at 7 p.m. Tuesday, Sept. 27, at Jackson State University’s Lee E. Williams Athletics and Assembly Center in celebration of Black College Day. The event is free, but reservations are required for admission. To reserve a ticket, send an e-mail to: kimberly.n.franklin@jsums.edu. Lee is a notable writer, director, producer, actor, and author who revolutionized both the landscape of independent cinema and the role of black talent in film. Widely regarded as a premiere African-American filmmaker, Lee is a forerunner in the ‘do it yourself’ school of filmmaking. Lee’s latest endeavor is the follow-up documentary If God is Willing and Da Creek Don’t Rise, which revisits the recently storm-ravaged GulfCoast region as residents attempt to rebuild in their cities while also demanding assistance and accountability from their political leaders. This film comes on the heels of When the Levees Broke: A Requiem in Four Acts, the groundbreaking first documentary that followed the plight of Americans stranded in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina.

(JACKSON, Miss.) — In its newly released study, Washington Monthly magazine ranked Jackson State University one of the top 10 institutions of higher learning across the country in terms of social mobility, research and service ratings. Coming in at No. 9 among 258 institutions, Jackson State outranked Princeton (No. 31), Yale (No. 39), the Georgia Institute of Technology (No. 54) and Howard (No. 73) universities. Jackson State is the only Historically Black College or University to break into Washington Monthly’s top 10. This year’s ranking is up significantly from last year, when JSU appeared No. 45 on the list. The research rating measures the rate at which students go on to receive Ph.D.s., the number of doctoral degrees awarded by the university and the amount of federal research dollars garnered. Last year Jackson State raised over $57 million research dollars. The service rating also is a reflection of the number of students serving in U.S. Army and Navy Reserve Officer Training Corps programs, the percentage of alumni in the Peace Corps, the percentage of students receiving Pell grants and the percentage of federal work-study grant money spent on community service projects.

Gorden will sign copies of the poster featuring him. The cost for both posters is $50. Hobbs founded the organization, Humanitarian Artists of America, to raise money for charities and nonprofit groups through the sale and auction of original art and prints. His posters have raised funds for groups including the Flight 93 National Memorial Campaign, the Afro-American Music Institute of Pittsburgh, the American Cancer Society, the American Diabetes Association, Meals on Wheels, and for people affected by Hurricane Katrina.

Designed specifically as a textbook for undergraduate courses in gifted education, early childhood education, counseling, and developmental psychology, the book offers a broad overview of foundational principles and practical approaches for developing the creative potential of children at school and home.

It is available at Amazon.com and other retailers. hearing on gender inequities in intercollegiate athletics, she specifically addressed the lack of women in athletic administration. “Women should not be limited to traditional positions in such as assistant or associate director of athletics. … In particular, when director of athletics positions become vacant, institutions should consider hiring a woman for the job,” she said in her prepared statement. Fuller’s words have proved prophetic. At the time, she was in one of those “traditional” roles as associate director of Intercollegiate Athletics at Indiana University of Pennsylvania. But she went on to crack glass ceilings at several schools. She was athletics director at Maryland-Eastern Shore, Tennessee State and Northeastern Illinois universities.

From the day children are born, all the way through high school, 92 percent of their time is spent at home. Only eight percent of their time will be spent at school. Go ahead and do the math: 13 years of school from kindergarten through 12th grade, 170 days of school each year on average, 6 hours of school each school day. When compared with 365 days in a year and 24 hours in a day, you can see just how small a portion of our children’s lives is spent at school. What we do as parents is vital to the kinds of people our children grow into and how much success our children will have, both in school and in life. We have to be involved. We are the only ones with enough opportunity to be a strong, consistent influence in our children’s lives. It is up to each of us to make sure our children’s needs are met, but that doesn’t mean that schools don’t play their own role. Schools and educators all share the same goals for your children that you have: each of you wants your child to succeed. Make it a priority to work with the school to be involved and engaged. Don’t wait for an invitation-- just go. You can even plan to visit when teachers or staff aren’t expecting you so you can see how the school regularly works. Remember not to disrupt students during the school day, though. Make sure dropping by is allowed at your school by checking with the school office first. It doesn’t even have to be in your child’s classroom. Ask the teacher or the principal where they could most use your help. Get involved in the decision-making and let your voice be heard. Even though children only spend eight percent of their time in the classroom, if you are involved in that part of their lives as well, the values and skills you promote at home are more likely to be present in school as well. Take time to spend the day with your child and learn new things together. Don’t just drop your child off at sports practice or a game. Watch him or her play and interact with others. You will learn about his or her strengths. The extent of your involvement with your child’s school life will always depend on what fits into your schedule and what makes sense for you and your family. Making an effort, no matter how small, shows your child that you care about his or her education, that you believe education is valuable, and that you believe he or she should value it as well.

Who Is Anne Flatch, Legal Researcher on ‘Trial and Error’? The new TV series Trial and Error is a mock crime documentary about poetry professor Larry Henderson (John Lithgow) who’s been accused of murdering his wife Margaret. While he’s not taking the murder charge very seriously, his young lawyer Josh Segal (Nicholas D’Agosto) is. Josh travels from New York to South Carolina to represent Henderson. There Josh hires a kooky investigator and legal researcher. Legal researcher Anne Flatch is portrayed by Sherri Shepherd, who was a legal secretary in real life before pursuing her standup comedy and acting career in 1990. She’s known for her roles on Rosewood (Dr. Anita Eubanks), K.C. Undercover (Agent Beverly), How I Met Your Mother (Daphne), 30 Rock (Angie Jordan), Less Than Perfect (Ramona Platt), Everybody Loves Raymond (Robert’s partner Sergeant Judy), Emeril (Melva LeBlanc), The Jamie Foxx Show (Sheila Yarborough), and Suddenly Susan (Miranda Charles), among others. Shepherd is also recognized as a host on The View and from the film Precious (Cornrows). Trial and Error airs Tuesdays at 10pm on NBC.
Steve Bannon spoke Tuesday in Fairhope, Ala., during a rally for US Senate candidate Roy Moore. FAIRHOPE, Ala. — It already felt a little like a victory party in Alabama Tuesday, where Senate candidate Roy Moore is suddenly feeling love from the Republican Party despite weeks of disclosures that he sexually pursued and assaulted underaged girls. The neck-and-neck special election contest in Alabama has become, for Bannon, the most extreme example of his “honey badger don’t give a [expletive]”-style of politics, a philosophy inspired by a viral video that shows a badger chasing a jackal and fighting a cobra in search of food. Along the way a narrator explains how the honey badger doesn’t care who he steps on or how disgusting his methods appear to others. Should Trump fear a Sen. Romney? A Senator Romney would probably serve as the counterweight trying to block President Trump’s takeover of the Republican Party. It is also the first of what Bannon and his ultraright, nationalist allies hope is a movement to elect more outsider candidates to the House and Senate. Tuesday evening, Bannon also tore into former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, a Republican who is a sharp Moore critic and a possible candidate for Senate in Utah if incumbent Senator Orrin Hatch opts to retire. Bannon’s support in the contest against Democrat Doug Jones has been crucial for Moore, the former renegade state judge and ultraright favorite who has been accused of sexually assaulting teenaged girls when he was a single man in his 30s. The contest, a special election set for Tuesday, is to replace Jeff Sessions who was tapped to be Trump’s attorney general. Roy Moore kissed his wife Kayla Moore during a campaign event at Oak Hollow Farm. Steve Bannon (left) introduced Roy Moore during a campaign rally. Moore moves the party so far away from the establishment that the previous rebels are suddenly seen as reasonable, Surabian said. “Roy Moore will normalize Ted Cruz,” he said, referring to the Texas senator whose antics contributed to a temporary government shutdown in 2013. The president was already planning a trip Friday to Pensacola, Fla., a city that’s so close to the Alabama border it’s in a region of the state known as Flora-bama. Ginger Poynter and other protesters who said they support the women that are speaking out against Roy Moore gather as he held a campaign rally. Jones is a former federal prosecutor who helped jail the man responsible for bombing the Atlanta Olympics. While in his federal post, he landed convictions for two Ku Klux Klansmen who bombed a church in Birmingham in 1963, killing four little girls. People attended a campaign rally for Roy Moore.

What does a collector look for in a Ferrari? This issue, we learn the answer to this and other fascinating questions from Prancing Horse collector Jon Shirley whose cars include the 1954 375 MM Scaglietti Coupé that won Best of Show at the prestigious Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance at the exclusive Carmel golf club last August. “All Ferraris are marvellous,” says Shirley, “but the ones I like have a backstory that makes them unique. It could be because of victories on the track or famous previous owners, as is the case with the 375 Scaglietti Coupé that won at Pebble Beach and once belonged to the great director, Roberto Rossellini”. Watch some clips from the interview here.

Did you know that Horse-Horse-Tiger-Tiger, is translated into, Mǎ Mǎ Hǔ Hǔ? Of course, the literal translation would not help you speak about two horses and two tigers with someone who speaks Chinese, but instead literally means, "so-so," to tell someone how your day is going. Okay so it is obvious that English is totally different than Chinese both in written and verbal communication. The pronouncing "four" in English is the sound quantitative to mean four units of something. However, uttering "four" to a Chinese person will have them thinking you are referring to death and this is considered impolite. The difference between our two worlds is like the polar opposite charges of subatomic particles. Literally the difference is black and white. Americans use white to celebrate weddings, baby showers, and black to give condolences to the deceased, however in China, white is used for respecting the dead, and black reflects life itself. How does different Culture look? What are some ways our Culture looks to foreigners? Péngyou means friend in Chinese. This a blog that follows the journey of our SOS China Student Ambassadors..

Two summers ago professional basketball entered a new era. LeBron James left Cleveland as a free agent and, in what seems to be a choice of words we won’t soon forget, “took his talents to south beach.” The basketball world hasn’t looked back since. It began with Cleveland fans, to really no surprise. Just seconds after LeBron’s “decision”, ESPN aired footage of piles of LeBron James jerseys being burned by the very populace he embraced for the prior 25 years of his life. Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert’s depressant tweets went viral that night, vowing to his fans a return to dominance without LeBron, and a new era of Cavaliers basketball. It all began to feel like the world was witnessing a really bitter break up. A day or two passed. And, in a move I’m sure most of the Heat organization now regrets, they decided to introduce their players in front of an arena full of fans, rather than a traditional press conference. Judging by the scene — smoke machines, confetti, screaming fans and a seemingly celebratory Big Three — you’d think they just won a championship. In a league where greatness is judged by championships first, and then numbers, could it get much more inappropriate? Yes. It could, and it did. Because LeBron James – the immature, inexperienced, championship-less idiot he was two years ago – vowed to his new city that he would win “not just one, not just two, not three, four, five, or six,” but SEVEN championships, before they even played a game together. If you’re a professional athlete and you’re wondering exactly how to turn an entire sport’s fan majority against you, that’s pretty much how its done. It was like adding fuel to a nuke. Last night that question was answered. Averaging more than thirty points and ten rebounds throughout the entire playoffs – something only guys named Shaq, Kareem, and Hakeem have done – LeBron James put the white noise aside and led his team to a championship. There’s a few ways to go about that question. You could be someone who simply won’t forgive LeBron for the way he mishandled leaving Cleveland. That’s understandable and totally a matter of opinion. My advice? Stay away from ESPN for the next two weeks. You could be someone who just refuses to give LeBron credit (most likely for “the decision”) and tosses up pathetic excuses for why his championship isn’t legitimate. My advice? Don’t be one of these people. Or, you could forget about your bias, and look at the facts. You could recognize the fact that LeBron James put up historic numbers this offseason AND Finals; Numbers only put up by three of the greatest centers of all time and Michael Jordan. You could recognize the fact that having other super stars around him doesn’t make his championship any less legitimate (in fact, the more you compare the Heat roster to other championship teams the less impressive it looks, which emphasizes LeBron’s role). Look at Championship teams throughout history and tell me this Heat team ranks anywhere in the top ten even. You could recognize that LeBron James is already a three time MVP, six-time All-NBA first teamer, four time All-NBA defensive first teamer (consecutively), finals MVP, and NBA champion. He’ll compete for many more of all of those. You could recognize that by the end of his career, LeBron will be top five all time in scoring, top 50 in rebounding, and top three in assists. His numbers will tower over those of greats like Oscar Robinson, Larry Bird, John Havlicek, and Elgin Baylor. You could recognize that there’s never been a professional basketball player in the world’s history whose bar has been placed higher than LeBron James’. He’s faced more constant speculation and pressure than anyone the game has seen. And its been since he was 18 years old. You could recognize that LeBron James should be forgiven, not because you have to like him, but because you have to respect him. He will go down as arguably the greatest basketball player of all time. He’s a champion now, and people are going to have to get used to that.

I made some final changes after looking at some things. Lock em' in. I'll play this year. These are all stocks I actually own so I hope this goes well. Edit: Also, big thanks to being willing to do this again! Just curious why Jan 4? The winner will be entitled to one year of free membership to TigerDroppings.com. as long as this site's owners don't charge a fee to be a member of it. I didn't know that this was serious contest with a real valuable prize. I'm in but I have to give this some thought. It’s just 3 trading days into the year and gives any procrastinators recovering from the year end holidays one last chance to join in. We waited too long, imo, this current contest (2018) to stop taking entrants and it resulted in some late picks that were already up big before the deadline came. Would you prefer a different deadline? For everyone who signed up this evening, I’ll add you to my spreadsheet tomorrow morning when I’m back at my computer. I’ll upvote your posts when I add your name so you’ll know you’re in. I’ll post a complete list of everyone participating showing each person’s picks (for you to check for data errors on my part) when we get close to the deadline date. I was the procrastinator this year so I can’t vote against that. Performance should all start on the same day, the following Monday open. In a perfect world, you’re right. The problem is I use MorningStar.com to provide the YTD performance percent which I export into my Excel spreadsheet and that’s what it is.......YTD. I don’t see an option for “January 7 to-date” performance. The only option would be make the deadline January 1, 2019 so YTD performance begins the next day which would be the first trading day of 2019. Big implications here with you giving out free TD memberships. Let’s get it right. The motion to move the deadline for participating in our World Famous Stock Pick 'em Contest to January 1 has been made and seconded. Hearing no objections, the motion carries. January 1 is now the deadline for joining our contest.
Great proximity to all the best high lights of Old Quebec...loved the heated pool that we used despite the cool weather outside...the meals were delicious and suppers were very healthy...a very friendly and helpful staff, they went above their call of duty to accommodate us - Location close to Old Quebec City gate; excellent parking in hotel gara... what people say » ge, self park worked well for us; helpful staff, spoke English; Hop On Hop Off stop in the parking area next to hotel front door so convenient for touring the city. The staff, specially a young man whos nickname is "Nico". He really made us feel that we were in our country, specially when we arrive and he heard us speak in our language, and start to speak with us in Spanish!!! We came from Puerto Rico. - Very good location. Right at the gate of old Quebec.
Be Kind is a small, personal, and unique retreat with space for 4 guests. It is important for us to guide you as much as possible during your juice and digital detox. Expect loving Be Kind staff and teachers who will share their energy with you and help you to find the right path in life. We have different teachers who are all unique in their own teaching. You will have the opportunity to learn a lot about your tech use and your spiritual site. The aim is to motivate you to really look inside and work on yourself during the retreat. Of course, we will always be there to guide or support you. Be Kind retreats is about internal attention and not about external attention. Don’t expect big groups or impersonal teachers. We create inspiration group circles where we encourage each other to listen to ourselves and share stories and energy. However, the retreat is focussed on the connection with yourself and not with others. Surrounded by fellow travellers, yogis, and open-minded people you will feel right at home. The location is perfect, in a quite authentic village in the mainland of Canggu. There is arranged free transportation to several hotspots and beaches in the neighbourhood throughout the day (don’t need to worry about riding a motorbike). You will find comfy hangouts around the garden, house, and kitchen. The rooms are big and fully furnished, so you will have your rest and privacy. We are most happy with environmentally thinking persons, who treat the villa with love and share their positive energy. All rooms have been designed to offer you maximum rest and privacy. There are two shared rooms and one private room. The interior is personal and unique which will make you feel right at home. All rooms come with en-suite bathroom, hot shower, air-conditioning, towels, fresh linen, and toiletries. This retreat does not just learn you how to surf, we believe that surfing is a great tool to overcome your fears, to be more confident in your daily life and to change your habits and negative thoughts. The ocean has a positive impact on human health, spending time in the water is a natural healer to let go of stress and heaviness. Surfing will make you more patient; when you are in the water, you have to wait for the perfect wave, you can’t force the perfect wave to arrive. You will surf four times with our experienced, Australian trained and certified surf coach. He will make sure you are safe, have fun and teach you how the ocean works, how to stand up, turn and take your own waves. We have created a workbook with several mindfulness exercises which you can do before and after each surf lesson. In the yoga shala of the villa, you will have one yoga class per day. The afternoon class is a perfect time to reflect on your day and reconnect with yourself. You will practice yoga in a small group where you will feel safe and in perfect balance. We will introduce you to different yoga styles. This is a great opportunity to learn more about each yoga style and to find out which style you most connect with. We offer hatha, yin, kundalini, restorative, guided meditation, yoga nidra and vinyasa. The lessons are suited for every level. If you have never practiced yoga before, our teachers will be there to guide you through every pose and explain you about each yoga style. While letting your muscles work during the surf and yoga sessions, it is important to allow your body to get some extra rest. A daily relaxing massage in a beautiful tropical spa will help your muscles heal and stay flexibel and confident in your own body. While rest is important, we don’t want you to feel bored. After the daily massage you can spend some time relaxing by the pool or walking in the rice paddies in the beautiful tropical spa. Be Kind retreats is about reconnecting with yourself. In order to do that, we believe that it is important to disconnect from social media and anything digital. No Facebook and Instagram, no phones and laptops and no Wi-Fi means less distractions, comparing and judging. It gives you the opportunity to learn how to do nothing, to enjoy being you, to be more mindful and to love yourself more. For some people this can be challenging, but all the Be Kind guests feel relieved, free and self-loving after their digital detox. Give yourself the opportunity to fully recharge, reconnect with yourself and let go of all toxic things that don’t serve you anymore. Bed in shared room with enclosed bathroom (max. 2 guests). Price is in Indonesian Rupiah. Kingsize bed in private room with enclosed bathroom (1 person). Price is in Indonesian Rupiah.

This plant is a member of the Solanaceae family and has over 4,000 years of traditional use in its native India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. It is a Medharasayan which is the Ayurvedic category of foods and nutrients that promote learning and memory retrieval. It is sometimes referred to as “Indian Ginseng” as it is traditionally used in conditions of debility, emaciation, impotence and premature aging. It is also sometimes referred to as Winter Cherry.

Firebrand Candle Company originally began as a craft project during the Christmas Season of 2012. Soon after, many of the people who received candles as gifts began to ask if I had ever considered starting a candle business. After completing a business planning course through the BUILD Institute in February 2013, I launched Firebrand Candle Company. Firebrand Candles are inspired by a desire to create intimacy and connection between people, a love of compelling aromas, and a drive to bring positive light to the city of Detroit. Each soy candle is named after a Detroit street and representative of its rich history and culture. The Goal - turn the sometimes-negative conversations regarding Detroit into ones much more warm, comforting, and inviting.

On 30.03.2017, Asst. Prof. Beni Cukurel was awarded “Henri Gutwirth Prize for Promotion of Excellence in Research” on his research associated with “Acoustic Resonance Enhanced Heat Exchangers”. In the modern technological world, many systems require heat to be either added or dissipated towards maintaining their operability and enhancing their thermodynamic efficiency. This change in gas/liquid temperature is typically provided by a heat exchanger (HE), which operates by associating two streams of different thermal potential. Due to form factor limitations of many size restrained applications, the state of the art is advancing towards more compact designs. This forms the basis towards higher performance and efficiency HEs – enabling more heat transfer for the same size heat exchanger unit. This can be achieved by means of designs having sets of perturbators (ribs, pins, fins etc.) in the heat exchange passageways, providing larger heat transfer surface area per unit of volume and promoting turbulence in the flow. This yields higher thermal efficiency at the expense of additional pressure penalty. Prof. Cukurel’s project is complementary to current existing HE designs, as he seeks to further increase the thermal efficiency of existing HE units without significant geometric modifications. In the scope of his work, the heat transfer in an existing unit is augmented using a standing acoustic wave. Preliminary research has achieved significant heat transfer enhancement (up to 25%) without inducing additional pressure drop.

[Mix engineer] Anyone who records and mixes professionally has done this at least once in their career—you tweak a snare or vocal track to perfection only to discover later that the EQ was bypassed the whole time. Or you were tweaking a different track. And if you’ve been mixing and playing around with … whether you’re a professional or just a hobbyist, if you’ve been doing this for a few years and you haven’t done that, then you’re lying. Yet you were certain you heard a change! Human auditory memory and perception are extremely fragile, and expectation bias and placebo effect are much stronger than people care to admit.

(Bloomberg) -- After eating the dust of its German rival for past three years, BMW AG is getting a faster start off the line in early 2019. BMW sales rose 2.9 percent in March and were roughly flat in the first quarter, as surging demand for X3 compact crossovers helped the brand surpass Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz. A slump for the small GLA crossover and GLE sport utility vehicle sent Mercedes sales down 9.3 percent for the first three months of the year. Fresh off a year in which it trailed Mercedes by fewer than 5,000 vehicles, BMW ended the first quarter with a luxury sales lead of 2,717 units. Toyota Motor Corp.’s Lexus had the best performance among the top luxury automakers in March, with a jump in RX SUV deliveries pacing an 8.2 percent increase. The brand boosted sales 4 percent in the quarter. Volkswagen AG’s Audi bounced back from a five-month streak of falling deliveries with a 1.1 percent gain in March, driven by the Q5 and Q7 SUVs. Deliveries are still down 3.9 percent so far this year.

Showing results for tags 'pkhex'. Greetings, Is it possible to edit ranks? I couldn't find any options, only current streaks, continue and records are available. I'm wondering if I can modify the date that I received wonder card when I import wc7 from Pokemon sun save file. I set the date as 11/20/2016 on my Nintendo 3DS, imported wc7 file, and found out the Pokemon Met Date wasn't matching with the date I received wonder card - it was recorded as 11/26/2016. I personally think the setting on wc7 file was set for 11/26/2016. Do you not support any PKHeX functionalties that enable to change the date that I received wonder card in my save file, Mystery gift section? If not, is it possible to find any way to change only the "Date received"? Hello! Forgive me if I'm in the wrong category or something, I'm new to this site as I just signed up for help. I've been trying to work PKHeX on my Mac for quite a while now. I've followed nearly every guide I can find but to no avail. I was wondering if anyone could help me by chance. I usually use this guide. I've used a few another ones, but most pages seem to lead me to the one I just mentioned. I try to do the easiest and top-most method with Winebottler. I've double-checked, I run everything the exact same as it is on that screenshot of the Winebottler "Install" screen. I've checked all 4 Winetricks but the only difference is I try to install the app it's creating directly onto the root of my 3ds's SD card. I used this guide for getting it on the SD card, if you're wondering where I install it. Whenever I have my screen the same as in the first guide, I click install and everything seems to run fine, with a box appearing at the bottom that says,"Creating "PKHeX App.app", and below that,"installing dotnet461". Problem is, my computer never seems to want to go past this step. I've left it running on that step for about 30 minutes, nothing happened and the Winebottler app eventually stopped responding. I left my computer running overnight and decided to come back to it the next day, and it just said,"Prefix aborted successfully." In place of where the install box was before. Am I doing something wrong? Is there any other method I should be using? Thanks for any replies in advance! Hey everyone, I just updated my PK Hex to the latest version and apparently some of my mons are invalid with the following reasons, how do I fix this? Ive never seen these issues before. 1. Invalid: Unable to match an encounter from origin game. 2. Invalid: PID-Nature mismatch. 3. Invalid: PID should be equal to EC [with top bit flipped]! Please help! I'm trying to edit a Pokemon Platinum .duc file I pulled from my Action Replay Dsi. However, when I open it with Pokegen it only shows a few pokemon, even though it says almost all of the boxes are full. Any help? Also, when I try to open the file in PKHex, an error comes up that says the file size is unsupported. Hi there! I'm having a couple of issues with pkhex: Recently I tried to use the mystery gift database to generate 2 legendary event mons: shiny Tapu Koko and Celebrate Victini. Pkhex flagged it as legal, but when I tried to use it online, it didn't work. I got the usual "There's something wrong with a pokemon on your team" game message. BUT when using a pk7 file from friends that had the same event pokemon working online, it worked, and it looks exactly the same like the MG database one. I've used the MG (mystery gift) database before to generate other legendary mon, like Hoopa from ORAS, it was also flagged as legal and it worked online. So far, the only ones that didn't work were shiny Koko and Celebrate Victini. Am I doing something wrong? Please help me. I've been using Pkhex for 2 years now and that's the first time I've experienced something like that. Thanks in advance. (REQUEST) (GEN 6) PokeGen all these BattleMons! I'm going to use it against my friends, who are already aware that they're not legal. I already made the files, just put them in your PkHEX service and trade it to me. My in game name is Sceptile, and my friend code is 4743-0960-3800. I play Pokemon Y. https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1EvFucL0y4fQsjxC6E73HbtcnvTKT-P3_ UPDATE: Someone genned me 6 of the Pokemon. The ones that still need to be genned are #306, #389, #445, #503, #530 and #693. Just to inform about bug found on shedinja sword dancer. We know that is impossible to shedinja learn sword dance, except if use the glitch on emerald where we choose to lvl up nincada at 25 (when he nincada learn sword dance). So, basically shedinja only learn this way and smogon treat as legal. ( https://www.smogon.com/dex/xy/pokemon/shedinja/uu/ ) On previous version of PKhex my shedinja was treated as legal. Obs: I dont play competive and this bug will not affect me because I only play using my desmume and vbalink. Im here just to inform Anyway, thank you, I appreciate your reading. The save loaded on pictures was my emerald.sav (GEN 3) When I open this shedinja on my BW2 (Gen V) the error is "Encounter PID mismatch" Hello, I'm a little confused about egg/relearn moves. My understanding was that a bred pokemon can inherit moves from its parents based on it's listed egg move list. For example: Cyndaquil - Moves. Cyndaquil, like many other pokemon, has a slew of egg moves listed. Nowhere in Cyndaquils' egg moves is flamethrower. Here is a Cyndaquil I bred: As you can see, flamethrower is the second relearn move listed. PKHEX thankfully sees this as being legal which it should be as the poke was bred and hatched in game. My question is, how do I know what moves can and can not be egg moves for a given pokemon? As it stands, my way of figuring this out is by simply punching in a move I'd like to have under relearn moves and see if pkhex gives me an error but I'd like a better approach if one exists. If anyone can shed any light on this I'd appreciate it. Thank you. On a side note, there are other instances of this happening for various pokes, I just used Cyndaquil as an example. Does anyone know how to modify the exchange values ?, that is; that is not 10 or 40 if it is not 340 or a number like that. I tried to explore with Pkhex but I really could not and I did not understand what he was doing. Thank you very much. I use gateway my game save is located within the new 3ds sd card ya know the back of the new 3ds moves save to desktop to try as well and same issue how do i fix this?

Kenya's ambassador to the UN Macharia Kamau. Photo | FILE. Kenya's United Nations envoy Macharia Kamau is leading a global effort in New York to promote the rights of people living with disabilities. Ambassador Kamau will chair a three-day meeting at the UN headquarters on June 10-12. As president of the conference of countries that have ratified a disability rights accord, he will moderate conversation on issues affecting one billion disabled people worldwide. In an interview with Nation.co.ke on Sunday, Ambassador Kamau said Kenya has made some progress in addressing the needs of its disabled citizens. However, in many developing countries, he added, progress is slowed by lack of political will and inadequate resources. “In some of our countries the condition of people with physical, mental or emotional disabilities is deplorable,” Mr Kamau told reporters at the UN on Monday. He noted that in poor nations, disabilities often result not from physical injury but from the effects of poverty, such as nutritional deficiencies and unhealthy air quality in homes. Ambassador Kamau was elected last year as head of the disability rights conference. He also serves as president of the Unicef board of directors and co-chair of a UN group working to formulate a global development agenda for the years following completion of the Millennium Development Goals effort in 2015.
Born out of a Burbank warehouse in 1985, AES today employs a staff of 25 dedicated individuals, including associate and support staff. AES provides soils engineering, engineering geologic and environmental services, like a soils engineering report, for hundreds of construction projects every year across Southern California. Every year our experience builds on that acquired in the years prior. The result is that AES has its own extensive, proprietary library of soils and geology maps for most areas of greater Los Angeles. When the region’s residents need to examine soil liquefaction within property lines, they do not hesitate to contact AES. Today there are dozens of city blocks in greater LA for which AES has performed foundation investigations and rendered geological, environmental and/or construction inspection services (like a percolation test) on almost every individual parcel in the block. The extensive ground we have covered in our decades of service has left us with invaluable body of knowledge; and, we are able to engage the information attained from one project on subsequent ones within the same vicinity. We employ a state-of-the-art search engine that provides detailed information from previous investigations with the click of a mouse. The result is we continue to get better and better at what we do. By streamlining our research process we save customers time and money without ever sacrificing the quality of the stormwater report you receive from us, for example. Fully licensed, and with a flexible staff, we can handle most types of jobs, large and small. Our strength lies principally in our diverse staff: we have engineers and scientists with specialized expertise in geotechnical, civil, hydraulic, and environmental engineering as well as environmental hydrogeology and engineering geology. The environmental geologist you need is here. The AES team has provided expert consulting services on a wide variety of projects: water treatment plants, subterranean structures, hillside acreages, power plants, energy distribution networks, skyscrapers, and much more. Over the years, AES has established crucial rapport with governmental review agencies across the County for the quality of its work and attention to detail. Because of this, we are able to streamline the report approval process and create faster turn-around times. We also have very loyal clients.

"Pansies" She was born in Buffalo, New York, only child of Emma C. Harmon and Oscar Folsom--who became a law partner of Cleveland's. As a devoted family friend Cleveland bought "Frank" her first baby carriage. As administrator of the Folsom estate after his partner's death, though never her legal guardian, he guided her education with sound advice. When she entered Wells College, he asked Mrs. Folsom's permission to correspond with her, and he kept her room bright with flowers. Though Frank and her mother missed his inauguration in 1885, they visited him at the White House that spring. There affection turned into romance--despite 27 years' difference in age--and there the wedding took place on June 2, 1886.
Abstract: As financial institutions globally try to resolve legacy conduct issues and rebuild trust with clients, recent congressional hearings showing senior banking executives being challenged on systematic misconduct within their banks are a stark reminder that work on organisational culture in the sector is as pressing now as at any point during the banking crisis of the last ten years. If positioned well in the organisation, compliance should be a culture-carrier and be present at those crucial moments when important decisions are being made. The authors share their experience in building the skills and capabilities required for compliance to ensure business is ‘complying with the spirit as well as the letter of prevailing regulation and law’. This paper will also explore what is required to advance towards a learning culture where learning and innovation happen organically and spontaneously rather than programmatically. Michael Roemer is currently the Group Head of Compliance for Barclays and has worked at the bank since joining as the Head of Barclays Internal Audit in 2012. He has a BS degree in Accounting from St John’s University and completed the Tuck Executive Programme at the Tuck School of Dartmouth College in 1998. Mark Buckle is currently the Head of Learning for Compliance at Barclays – a role he took over in December 2015. Mark specialises in Learning & Development within Control Functions in the Financial Sector, performing that role most recently in Barclays Internal Audit and previously as an Audit Partner at the Royal Bank of Scotland Group and as Head of People Management for the audit function at Lloyds Banking Group during the transaction between Lloyds and HBOS. In his time at Barclays Mark has also focused on the Culture Agenda.

Being diagnosed with cancer is nightmarish. It is not something anyone ever wants to encounter. But here’s the thing – regardless of your age, gender or race, cancer does not discriminate. So Instead of sulking and getting all depressed and allowing cancer to drain the life out of you, stand up and fight it today. Do not let cancer take away everything you love, including the life you once enjoyed. Read: 7 Ways To Not Let A Cancer Diagnosis Define You. How we face life’s obstacles defines us. Hearing the words you have cancer can be frightening and before you know it your mind starts to race to all the countless therapies, treatments, doctor’s visits and uncertainties. Now stop there a minute. Here is where you got to realise, like in every obstacle, cancer is no different and so you must not let it define you. The key to overcoming cancer, is to realise the importance of keeping a positive mind so you can focus better, heal and look towards a healthier future. Doctor’s appointments and cancer treatments can put a toll on you. So it is important to seek emotional support from family and friends. Taking time to spend with your loved ones can bring a lot of encouragement and help you take your mind from constant worry about doctor’s appointments and treatment follow-ups. Cancer can put you in a week and vulnerable state. Therefore, it is important to seek help and advice from family, friends or cancer support groups. You need to know that there are people who are willing to help and so it is important to not be afraid to ask for help. Do not hold on to your struggle. Learn to let them go by talking to family or friends or writing them down. Sometimes journaling your pain or hurt can bring more ease than you know it. Besides, by sharing your struggle or writing them down, it might become an inspiration to someone, someday. The best way to shake of cancer is to do something you love. This one of the best ways to rediscover your passion or hobbies again. This could include sports, dancing, reading your favourite novels, or going for hike. Embracing your hobbies will improve your life and keep you happy and motivated. Whatever you age is, do not let cancer stop you from living your dreams. If there is a goal or dream you have yet to achieve, make it happen now. Whether it is to start a business, get a college degree or travel to country you have not been before, do not let cancer steal your dreams. Relive these dreams again. Do not let cancer consume the life of you. Deciding to let go of your fear of cancer is the first step you can ever make to living a passionate and joyful life you deserve. Let go of your worries – for the best way to survive cancer is to simply live! Cancer is a physically and emotionally painful journey that no one ever wants to encounter or face in their lifetime. Still, that does not mean you should let it control you. Instead of worrying, walk, live and enjoy your life one moment at a time.
The Pittsburgh Steelers are clear that they intend to return to the solid running attack that's expected of their franchise, and Rashard Mendenhall is their established starter. This action figure 2-pack features a new pose for the running back, and the accompanying Troy Polamalu figure is also a different version of his original figure from 2006's NFL 14 series. That figure featured Polamalu in long sleeves with a snowy base, while this version has no sleeves and no snow, a more traditional look for the leader of the Pittsburgh defense. Grab this 2-pack and wave your Terrible Towel for Troy Polamalu and Rashard Mendenhall!
Valentine’s Day is less than a week away now which means it’s time to start thinking about flowers, chocolate, teddy bears, and, of course, your loved ones. This special holiday of love can either be a great thing or a not so great thing depending on who you ask. Some people enjoy it while others can’t wait to get it over with. Junior Amber Mount says there isn’t much she likes about Valentine’s Day, but there certainly are a whole lot of things she dislikes. “I honestly don’t like anything about Valentine’s Day. I dislike everything about it,” said Mount. People can do a number of things on Valentine’s Day, like going to see a movie, going out to eat, or just having fun with that special someone. For those who happen to be single this year, they have the freedom to do whatever they want, even if it means staying home and watching Netflix all night. “On Valentine’s Day I usually just sit at home and watch Netflix,” said Mount. Whether you’re in a relationship or not, Valentine’s Day is a time where you will be surrounded by love no matter what. If you’re wishing you had a significant other to celebrate with, don’t feel bad. There are plenty of people out there who will be having their own fun this year. “For any girl or boy who’s going to be single for it this year, I feel you. Come hang with me,” said Mount.
The KU Ph.D. program admits students with either bachelor's or master's degrees. Qualifying for a Ph.D. from the Department of Sociology at the University of Kansas entails completing a sequence of steps. Students must complete required coursework, prepare a Professional Portfolio, write and successfully defend a master's thesis, complete examination requirements in two areas of specialization, draft and successfully defend a dissertation proposal, and successfully complete a doctoral dissertation. Our Ph.D. program is a vibrant intellectual community of 20-plus “core” faculty and affiliated sociologists on the Lawrence and medical campus and 45-plus graduate students. We admit graduate students with either bachelor's or master's degrees. Our faculty members are nationally and internationally recognized scholars with impressive records of research, publication, teaching, and grant-funded study. Founded in 1890, we are the oldest sociology program in the United States, and, as such, we have a long and distinguished history of rigorous training in both qualitative and quantitative study. We subscribe to an apprenticeship philosophy of graduate education in which faculty and students treat education as a joint enterprise. The department is noted for the intense exchange of ideas among its graduate students, a strong culture of student mentoring and support, and faculty-student collaboration. Graduate students also play an active role in departmental affairs; they serve on most departmental committees, participate in the Sociology Graduate Student Association (SGSA), and edit a research journal, Social Thought and Research (STAR). The majority of graduate students are funded as graduate teaching assistants, and receive continuous training and support in a teaching seminar. Others are supported as graduate research assistants on faculty research projects.A few advanced graduate students have taught in other departments and at nearby colleges and universities. Professional socialization is an important component of our program: Our students are encouraged to participate at professional meetings (e.g., Midwest Sociological Society, American Sociological Association, Sociologists for Women in Society) and submit their work (especially their master's thesis) for publication. Graduate students also host the annual Blackmar Lecture Series, inviting new sociology professionals to a public lecture at KU. The department allows students to specialize in various areas of sociology, and also offers a dual-doctorate degree in sociology and gerontology. Students are also encouraged to take courses from and work with the number of affiliated sociologists who have appointments in other units on the Lawrence and medical center campuses. From their first semester in the graduate program, students will prepare a Professional Portfolio of their graduate work. The Professional Portfolio should be seen as an on-going systematic collection of selected work that can demonstrate achievement and development. It is frequently expanded, revised, and updated. For example, an incorporated seminar paper that is later revised should be updated in the Portfolio. Likewise, Portfolio Statements should be reconsidered and re-written in light of continued study and intellectual development. The Portfolio should be a PDF document, so that it may be easily accessible to faculty for evaluation. A sample table of contents may be viewed here. ​All course requirements for the Ph.D. must be completed within 5 semesters of first enrollment in the program at the Ph.D. level. In addition, students are required to demonstrate command of one specialty area within 3 semesters of first enrollment in the program and of a second specialty area within 5 semesters of first enrollment. Having demonstrated command of a the second specialty area, students have one semester to complete a comprehensive oral examination and defend a dissertation proposal.
At the suggestion of Avi "Two Cokes" Freedman I spent the next two days in a high-limit mixed game, a combination of Hold 'Em and Omaha Hi/Lo with a betting structure of $300/$600. This game was referred to as "300/600 HO." There were acronyms for just about every combination of games and most of the big action tended to be in the mixed games. I did pretty well in this game, winning nicely on Friday and losing about half back on Saturday, although I still wasn't really sure I know how to play limit Hold 'Em. It was fun playing with all those big chips; that was for sure. Foxwoods was a rather unpleasant place to play, although like most modern card rooms there was no smoking allowed. The cocktail service typically took 10-15 minutes to retrieve an order. There were no comps to speak of and they had a no cell-phone policy, not just at the tables but anywhere in the poker room. I asked a floorperson about it and he said someone had used a camera phone to take pictures of the players and posted them on the Internet so they banned cell phones. I didn't bother to point out that anyone taking a picture would take it before they could yell at him and the people they were yelling at, talking on the phones, were not taking pictures. He went on to say they wanted to ban food from the poker room because it made a mess. Those darned customers, always making things inconvenient for the employees. I left the game early on Friday to go to the Full Tilt Poker dinner they were putting on for the winners of their on-line satellites. One of the guys had bought in for $4.40 and made it all the way to the big event. We all wished him luck. Dinner was at the award-winning Boom restaurant in nearby Stonington, CT. The place was owned by Erik "Rounders" Seidel's sister-in-law and she rolled out the red carpet for the guests. I probably could have finagled an invitation from Full Tilt since many of my friends were affiliated with the site but I ended up going as Avi Two-Cokes' brother Noam's date. They brought around huge plates of delicious hors d'oeuvres and poured a yummy little California Cabernet, which I drank too much of so I was glad I had the day off tomorrow. Among the Tilters present were Erik, Andy "The Rock" Bloch, Howard "Bub" (The Professor) Lederer, John "JJ" Juanda, Phil Ivey, Allen Cunningham, Melissa Hayden, and Jennifer Harman. I was also pleased to meet Thomas "Raze It" Giorgi, one of the best players on Full Tilt. The steak I had for the entrée was world class. I had come over on the bus but snuck into the VIP limo for the ride home. I spent Saturday recovering from the wine while the first half of the 674 entrants played. My turn came Sunday. I drew table 10, seat eight. There was no one at the table I recognized but I just got no cards all day. Eventually former WSOP champ Huck Seed came and sat on my left but he busted out quickly. Finally I gambled on a pair of Nines in early position and called a reraise all in by an unpredictable player on the small blind. He had Jacks. I didn't improve and I was out of the contest early. I went up to the VIP lounge and found WPT finalists Matt Matros and Russell Rosenblum commiserating. We were all exhausted and about to leave when Erin Ness, the girl from Maxim magazine who got a lot of TV time in this year's World Series main event, walked in. All of a sudden everyone had plenty of energy and we hung around talking to Erin for a couple hours. I had already booked my return flight for Monday in anticipation of busting out the first day. Andy "The Rock" Bloch busted soon after I did and we made plans to drive up to Boston together to catch our flights. We used some wampum to buy gas and headed up about four hours before flight time, leaving us plenty of room for error and traffic. It was a good thing, too, because the Neverlost, for some reason, took us through scenic Rhode Island surface streets instead of taking the Mass Pike. We saved $6.10 in tolls and got to the airport on time anyway. The evening Alaska flight left punctually and I watched a couple movies on the digEplayer while downing scotch and soda. I enjoyed I, Robot, a Will Smith sci-fi flick only loosely based on Asimov's book of the same name. Then I watched Around the World in 80 Days, a children's adventure movie that I picked just because Jackie Chan was in it. Both movies entertained but didn't make my list of all-time greats. Shortstack picked me up in the black T-Bird and whisked us back to Kirkland, home of Costco and us. My next tournament series was at Bellagio in December.
Arabs sometimes claim that, as "Semites," they cannot possibly be anti-Semitic. This, however, is a semantic distortion that ignores the reality of Arab discrimination and hostility toward Jews. Arabs, like any other people, can indeed be anti-Semitic. The term "anti-Semite" was coined in Germany in 1879 by Wilhelm Marr to refer to the anti-Jewish manifestations of the period and to give Jew-hatred a more scientific sounding name.(1) "Anti-Semitism" has been accepted and understood to mean hatred of the Jewish people. The Muslim attitude toward Jews is reflected in various verses throughout the Koran, the holy book of the Islamic faith. "They [the Children of Israel] were consigned to humiliation and wretchedness. They brought the wrath of God upon themselves, and this because they used to deny God's signs and kill His Prophets unjustly and because they disobeyed and were transgressors" (Sura 2:61). According to the Koran, the Jews try to introduce corruption (5:64), have always been disobedient (5:78), and are enemies of Allah, the Prophet and the angels (2:97­98). Still, as "People of the Book," Jews (and Christians) are protected under Islamic law. The traditional concept of the "dhimma" ("writ of protection") was extended by Muslim conquerors to Christians and Jews in exchange for their subordination to the Muslims. Peoples subjected to Muslim rule usually had a choice between death and conversion, but Jews and Christians, who adhered to the Scriptures, were allowed as dhimmis (protected persons) to practice their faith. This "protection" did little, however, to insure that Jews and Christians were treated well by the Muslims. On the contrary, an integral aspect of the dhimma was that, being an infidel, he had to openly acknowledge the superiority of the true believer--the Muslim. In the early years of the Islamic conquest, the "tribute" (or jizya), paid as a yearly poll tax, symbolized the subordination of the dhimmi. Later, the inferior status of Jews and Christians was reinforced through a series of regulations that governed the behavior of the dhimmi. Dhimmis, on pain of death, were forbidden to mock or criticize the Koran, Islam or Muhammad, to proselytize among Muslims or to touch a Muslim woman (though a Muslim man could take a non­Muslim as a wife). At various times, Jews in Muslim lands were able to live in relative peace and thrive culturally and economically. The position of the Jews was never secure, however, and changes in the political or social climate would often lead to persecution, violence and death. Jews were generally viewed with contempt by their Muslim neighbors; peaceful coexistence between the two groups involved the subordination and degradation of the Jews. When Jews were perceived as having achieved too comfortable a position in Islamic society, anti-Semitism would surface, often with devastating results: On December 30, 1066, Joseph HaNagid, the Jewish vizier of Granada, Spain, was crucified by an Arab mob that proceeded to raze the Jewish quarter of the city and slaughter its 5,000 inhabitants. The riot was incited by Muslim preachers who had angrily objected to what they saw as inordinate Jewish political power. 1.

During pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) implantation, inaccurate measurements of hemodynamic parameters due to infection or thrombosis of PAC can result in severe complications. In order to develop a new PAC material, we evaluated the antibacterial and antithrombotic activities of the two types of PAC (Swan Ganz catheter and prototype catheter) in 14 pigs. In the 3-day group, bacterial infection rate was not different between the two types of PAC. In the 7-day group, bacterial infection rate of the prototype catheter was twice as elevated as that of the Swan-Ganz catheter. In the 3-day group, thrombus formation rate of the prototype catheter was twice as elevated as that of the Swan-Ganz catheter. In the 7-day group, thrombus formation rate was the same for the two types of PAC. Here, we report an experimental pig model that confirms differences in antibacterial and antithrombotic activities. Pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) has been widely used in critical care since the 1970s. It is reported that 1.5 million PACs are used annually in the United States to monitor hemodynamic status of critically ill patients . It plays an important role in assessing the patient’s condition in the intensive care unit or operating room, establishing a diagnosis of underlying pathology and deciding on the treatment plan by measuring hemodynamic parameters, such as cardiac output, mixed venous oxygen saturation and intra-cardiac pressures [2–6]. PAC consists of blood compatible catheter, temperature sensor and monitoring system. Biofilm formation due to infection or thrombosis near temperature sensor has been reported to cause serious problems [7–9]. As a result, the sensitivity of sensor was also reduced . Currently, most cardiovascular medical devices are coated with lubricant, antithrombotic or antimicrobial agents. But there are no products that fundamentally solved serious side effects caused by prolonged implantation. We compared the antibacterial and antithrombotic activities of the most commonly used PAC, Swan-Ganz catheter (CCCO Combo catheter: Vigilance II, Edwards® Lifesciences, California, USA), with those of the prototype catheter in a pig model in an effort to develop a new catheter material. Main difference between the two types of PAC is antithrombogenecity. Prototype catheter improved antithrombotic activity through a newly developed heparin coating procedure. Prototype catheter was composed of 72% Pellethane® 2363-55D (CAS # 37383–28-1, Compounding Solutions, Lewiston, Maine, USA), 20% Barium Sulfate (CAS # 7727–43-7, Compounding Solutions, Lewiston, Maine, USA) and 6% AD85H-M® (Antimicrobial agent, Compounding Solutions, Lewiston, Maine, USA). The shape of prototype catheter was similar to that of Swan-Ganz catheter. Because several studies have documented that the cardiovascular system in pig is similar to that in humans, when compared with other animal models [11–13], we experimented with 14 female pigs. The subjects of this study were female Yorkshire Swine pigs weighing 45 ± 5 kg. The animals used in our experiments came from farms (XP bio® or Optipharm®, Cheongju, Korea) licensed by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, Republic of Korea. Pigs were moved from this farm to the Laboratory Animal Research Center Korea University College of Medicine 7 days before experiment and were housed in individual cages under controlled environments until experiment. Bilateral external jugular veins were used to reduce errors due to individual difference (Fig. 1a). Experiments were conducted as follows. Prophylactic antibiotics (cefazolin 1 g, Chong Kun Dang®, Seoul, Korea) were injected intravenously 1 h before skin incision. General endotracheal anesthesia was induced with thiopental sodium 5–10 mg/kg and vecuronium bromide 0.1 mg/kg. Bilateral external jugular veins were exposed under sterile condition. Before jugular vein clamping, unfractionated heparin 50 IU/kg was injected intravenously. The fragment of catheter cut into 3 cm length was inserted into the vein via a tiny slit and were held to the vein with 6–0 prolene suture, which was used to close the venotomy (Fig. 1b). After hemostasis, the surgical wound was closed layer by layer. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH, Clexane, Sanofi-Aventis®, Paris, France) at a dose of 1 mg/kg was injected subcutaneously every day until the catheters were removed. Three days later, 7 pigs underwent reoperation to remove the catheters. External jugular vein containing the catheter was resected into 4 cm length. We were careful not to disturb any thrombus that may have been present. The remaining 7 pigs underwent reoperation 7 days later. At the end of the operation, all pigs were euthanized by intravenous injection of potassium chloride 2 mEq/kg. Catheter tip culture was performed, and the culture was subsequently incubated for 48 h to evaluate antibacterial activity. The results are listed in Table 1. In the 3-day group, the bacterial infection rate was not different between the two types of PAC (42.86%). In the 7-day group, the bacterial infection rate of the prototype catheter (57.14%) was twice as elevated as that of the Swan-Ganz catheter (28.57%). Early in the experiment, the bacterial infection rate was as high as in the two types of PAC. The cultured bacteria were mainly normal flora in the gastrointestinal tract or the skin [14–16]. Therefore, contamination was suspected. After more carefully attending to sterilization and dressing, the bacterial infection rate decreased towards the end of the experiment. Catheters implanted in pigs were isolated and examined under a microscope to determine the presence of thrombus. The weight of thrombus was measured to evaluate antithrombotic activity from the 4th experiment. The results are listed in Table 2. In the 3-day group, the thrombus formation rate of the prototype catheter (85.71%) was twice as elevated as that of the Swan-Ganz catheter (42.85%). In the 7-day group, the thrombus formation rate was not different between the two types of PAC (71.43%). In the 3-day group, the mean thrombus amount of the prototype catheter (0.12 g) was six times as elevated as that of the Swan-Ganz catheter (0.02 g). In the 7-day group, the mean thrombus amount was 0.07 g in the prototype catheter and 0.12 g in the Swan-Ganz catheter. Despite anticoagulation therapy with LMWH, an increase in vulnerability to thrombus formation was observed in the PAC group, regardless of the type. In conclusion, after the 7-day implantation, there were differences in the rate of infection and thrombus formation between the Swan-Ganz catheter and the prototype catheter. The differences in these outcomes based on the material of the catheter. This research was supported by the Bio & Medical Technology Development Program of the National Research Foundation (NRF) & funded by the Korean government (MSIP & MOHW) (2015M3A9E2028644). JWH performed in vivo experiments and drafted the manuscript. YSS, JJK and HHS designed in vivo experiments and helped to draft the manuscript. All authors read and approved the final manuscript. The Korea University College of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IRB No. korea-2016-0118) approved this experiment protocol.

The neshama (soul) can only enter this world in a physical body. The body is the soul's garment to attain its purpose in this world, as well as directly offering an instrument for elevation. Only through and with the body can we carry out the practical mitzvos of the Torah. "Guard yourself and guard your soul very much lest you forget the day when you stood before HaShem Your G-d at Horev" (Deuteronomy 4:9-10). The Kli Yakar explains: "'Guard yourself' means taking care of the body." "The wise person has his eyes in his head" (Koheles 2:14) -- "He sees what is ahead" (Avot 2:9). Good health is a precious gift, and the wise person does everything necessary to protect it from possible hazards by taking proper care of the body. On the other hand, "The fool looses everything he is given" (Chagiga 4a). Our sages teach us that when a doctor heals the sick, the doctor is performing the mitzva of returning lost property: "And you shall return it to him" (Deuteronomy 22:2) - "This refers to the loss of the person's body, i.e. his health" (Sanhedrin 73a; see Rambam's Commentary on Mishneh Nedarim 4:4). I’m going to debase myself now, publicly. I have no strange fetish for exposing my personal business, but because someone else did so doing affecting me, perhaps my doing so will make a difference. I am a foolish man. Though it’s a passive foolishness, it’s foolishness still. For so many mitzvot I work hard, go out of my way, and invest serious effort, money and time. Yet for this mitzvah my actions have been purely passive. And it almost killed me. My problem is simple. I spend most of my day in front of a computer, as do so many others nowadays. No different than many other sedentary and office jobs, or maybe it is – more concentration, less physical movement, sitting for hours on end. This is my work, as well as many side efforts including this blog. More and more time…sitting. The result: Over the past 25 years I gained 70 pounds. Being I started as a "solid guy" and am of average height, the effects are...not positive. What does 70 pounds mean with a sedentary lifestyle? Tired all the time, without energy, irritable, frequently out of breath, hot flashes, poor sleep, difficulty with concentration & memory, receding gums, and constant cramping. "I don't feel well", "I just can't", "Sorry, I'm not up for it", these have become my constant state of being. In middle age, this is a disaster. Now I just started learning Brazilian Jiu Jitzu with a friend on Sundays as well. IY"H, we should make our bodies healthy keilim for Torah! If you can afford it, I recommend Pilates in a proper Pilates centre with machines. It improves strength and posture. If not, then walking (not too fast otherwise it damages the shins) is free and good. Stretch too, that is good for the back. I knocked off 15 kilo a number of years ago by cutting out carbohydrates and grains except a bit on Shabbat. I eat lots of cooked veggies and am not hungry. Recently I found that a few had returned, and I tweaked the regime and got them off, too. Contact me if you want help.
Moving is one of those moments that can be very exciting or stressing. You should seek for the services of professional movers if you don’t want those kind of experiences. Below are some of the advantages of hiring reliable movers view here for more. The second advantage of hiring professional movers is that all your possessions will be insured as well as safe. It is worth noting that moving by yourself means that you take the risk of no compensation if anything happens to your household items. Hiring the services of professional movers is advantageous as it is their priority to ensure that all your items are kept well. It is worth noting that the moving company will be in a position to compensate you if anything happened to your household possessions during the moving process. The last advantage of hiring the services of professional movers is that they are inexpensive compared to doing the task by yourself. Moving by yourself will be expensive since you must buy bubble wraps and other necessities that might make the costs go even higher than those charged by movers. The cost estimates of the professional movers will be quite low they already have the moving equipment that for your case you will have to purchase. Doing the moving by yourself will also require extra labor to help you load and offload heavy household items thus digging deeper into your pocket.

This year I've jumped a tax bracket (15% to 25%), thanks to having a real job (not a graduate student stipend) and working real hard at it. But I had an idea of how to dip back into the lower tax bracket by saving more for retirement. Say I have $40,000 of taxable income this year. The 25% tax bracket starts at $34,000. I figured that if I opened a retirement account that uses pre-tax dollars (like an individual 401K), I could claim that deduction. If I contributed $6,001 to that fund, I'd deduct that and have a taxable income of $33,999, putting me in the 15% tax bracket. Instead of owing 25% of $40,000 (which is $10,000), I'd owe 15% of $33,999 (which is $5,100). I'd have locked up $6,001 to save $4,900. I asked some people about this scheme. I read some money blogs (investing for retirement, frugality, etc.) and decided to ask one of them about my scheme. He wrote a blog post answering my question (and renamed me), but didn't really address the scheminess of my scheme. Sure, it's great to save more for retirement, and it doesn't make much sense to have two IRAs (a Roth and a Traditional), but would it really reduce my tax burden so dramatically? No. I didn't understand how tax brackets work. I thought that I'd pay 15% of all my $33,999 taxable income (total=$5,100) or 25% of all my $34,000 taxable income (total=$8,500), with no middle ground. But it's not like that. EVERYBODY pays 10% on the first $8,375, then 15% on the next ($34,000-$8,375=) $25,625, then 25% on any amount over that, and so forth. So if I had carried out my scheme, my tax burden (on $33,999) would be $4,681. Without opening the new retirement account, I'd have a taxable income of $40,000, and a tax burden of $6,181. It would really only save me $1,500, which is what you'd expect from a $6,000 deduction in the 25% tax bracket. I realize this may be jibberish. The point is that there isn't much to be gained (or lost) by jumping tax brackets. It's not that big a deal. I'll probably open a 401K anyway. It doesn't hurt to save money when possible.
Let me ask you this question. If you were faced with a criminal offence, would you face the prosecutor, the judge and the jury alone? Probably, not! You would go to court in the company of a good lawyer. Similarly, if you are faced with debt problems and you are considering declaring bankruptcy, or a proposal to your creditors, it is not a good idea to face the trustee alone. Be warned that the bankruptcy trustee is the prosecutor, the judge and the jury all rolled into one. He works for the Bank and not for you. • Paying off creditors with the assets in order of priority class. • To make periodic reports to the court on the progress of the bankruptcy. A bankruptcy trustee, like other trustees, has a fiduciary duty to be responsible for the funds under his/her care. A friend of mine from the Bahamas went to a bankruptcy trustee to declare bankruptcy. The Trustee was very nice to him in the information gathering stage to such an extent that he felt he and the trustee were friends. “What’s your name, job, income, RRSPs, homeowner and so on? In the process the trustee found out that my friend was from the Bahamas. “Oh, you are from the Bahamas? The trustee queried. I hear it is a beautiful place. I would like to visit there someday” “Oh, Yes. I’m from the Bahamas and it is a beautiful place. I own a nice home on the beach. You may stay there for free if and when you visit.” My friend proudly answered. Before my friend realized, his beach-home in the Bahamas was sold to pay off his debts in Canada.

One of the single most important ideas in organisation is the sales funnel. Sales funnels can raise your revenue online by automating your organisation. They provide a path of the very least resistance to expanding and also scaling your business on auto-pilot. But after spending time with some of the globe’s best online marketers, I can inform you with near assurance, not just just how sales funnels will certainly permit you to make even more loan online, but which specific funnels you ought to execute. Now, if you’re anything like me, you might be averse to particular funnels. For instance, I’m never an ecommerce man, however I do recognize that free-plus-shipping funnels are absolutely squashing it. In fact, just this past week, while participating in the Closing Table Mastermind with Perry Belcher and also Roland Frasier, I acquired more insight right into the appealing “tripwire” funnel, supposedly created by Perry Belcher. Nevertheless, Belcher didn’t create the principle. He drew that from an old Columbia House ad that sold 13 CDs or tapes for the huge rate of $1.00. Remember it? But we all understand that this irresistible deal (also known as tripwire) had way more to it than just the $1.00 cost. Behind-the-scenes, there was a continuity program at work. In Columbia House’s’ version, this was called adverse alternative payment. That means, you immediately get routine monthly shipments (along with an expense) unless you specifically specify or else. So why is this so effective and also what does it involve sales funnels? In fact, what you’ll discover is that Columbia House’s sales funnel was quite basic. You just chose the CDs or tapes you desired for a buck, after that obtained a normal monthly delivery each and every single month at a pre-defined rate. They would continually bill you for those CDs or tapes each and every single month. There were variants of this deal as well where you could grab 11 CDs or tapes for one dime then get the 12th totally free. Regardless you check out it, these were all irresistible deals. This was too excellent to skip. But what Columbia House as well as various other firms recognized was that, although they would lose money out of eviction, they would, generally, in time, generate income turn over initially. Which is the power of the sales funnel. Prior to automation, this is just how sales funnels functioned. And also, if you called in, you would obtain a real-time person efficiently walking you with the funnel. The Columbia House instance provides deep understanding into the psychology of an offer that’s irresistible. By first determining the life time value of a client and also their retention rate, Columbia House figured out that it might invest a particular amount of loan acquiring consumers and still be highly lucrative. That’s basically what’s finished with sales funnels today. And what really makes those sales funnels so powerful are tripwires. Today, it’s the tripwire that develops the tempting offer. Although Columbia House really did not rather have major up-sells or down-sells in their funnels, they developed a simple 2 action funnel that worked. It worked because the tripwire was so appealing. It appealed deeply to the consumer. After all, exactly how can you stand up to an offer like that for 12 or 13 CDs or tapes for $1 or 1 cent when they were retailing at around $10 each at the time. An additional powerful example of this was via Sports Illustrated. In fact, Sports Illustrated was properly on the decrease at the time it introduced its revolutionary tripwire. There’s something concerning substantial items that individuals just connect with. Even when you’re supplying a digital info product on the back end, by sweetening the handle a substantial good, you can quite actually send your conversions via the roof. In the example of Sports Illustrated, take yourself back to 1990 when magazine subscription prices were beginning to leave. In that duration, Sports Illustrated endured a 7% decline in their blood circulation in the initial half of the year. Now, no matter what they did, they were incapable to obtain the subscription prices up. Even by supplying deep discounts on memberships, customers weren’t grabbing it. Plus, if they marked down too outstanding, it would certainly influence their capability to obtain advertisers paying costs prices without revealing that customers were paying near to the complete cover cost of the magazine. Sports Illustrated, had by Time, Inc., had not been the only publication that was enduring under the business’s umbrella. Individuals publication had actually additionally experienced an extreme decline of 5%. Time, Inc., recognized that it needed to do something quickly. So it started to provide a tripwire that included sports bungles on VHS. However, the price was excessively high and there were only many bloopers it could provide. So, they resorted to the football phone as the brand-new tripwire. Why the football phone? First, it interested the target market. And, it was unique as well as exciting. Far more exciting than a boring magazine membership. The football-shaped phone idea was developed by Sports Illustrated’s supervisor of circulation at the time, Michael Loeb. Back then, marketing on cord was additionally really economical. Plus, the phone, which was sourced from China, only cost a couple of bucks “landed”. So everything made good sense. Loeb serviced the logistics of this deal for lots of months. Nevertheless, that wasn’t the only offer. They also concocted an offer that contained a sneaker phone. If you’ll think back to 1990-1991, it was both offers that were running nearly concurrently. Discuss an early-on split-test, right? So, what were the results of all this? Over 1 million brand-new customers. That’s right. And also those offers just competed a limited time. But it effectively saved the company. That’s the power of a tripwire offer. It’s a substantial product that obtains individuals thrilled regarding whatever else the core deal is. In fact, some individuals will only acquire what you’re marketing entirely for the uniqueness of the substantial tripwire offer. Sales funnels are among the solitary most powerful ideas in service today for an extremely specific factor. It’s not simply the instance of the tripwire that’s effective. It’s the whole kitty caboodle, so to speak. There are a lot of components as well as elements to what make a sales funnel job so well that I intended to break it down and offer some even more instances to supply a deeper understanding to how you can utilize them to boost your revenue online. Now, if you’re not using a sales funnel now, or if you’re just finding what a sales funnel is, after that there are a couple of methods you can quickly leverage this powerful principle in your service to create eruptive outcomes. Firstly, if you do not have a ClickFunnels account, go below and register for the 14-day cost-free trial. When you have actually configuration your account, get a custom-made domain name and also start developing your funnel. If you need aid, see several of the on-boarding video clips consisted of with ClickFunnels. It matters not if you have an existing organisation or you’re working to arrangement a brand-new company, funnels are the trick to expanding as well as scaling despite where you’re beginning with. Nonetheless, there are 5 particular methods you can use sales funnels to raise your income now. It matters not what service you’re in or what you’re marketing, you can take advantage of these today, right now, to produce explosive results. At the Inner Circle mastermind today, Russell Brunson studied the hook-story-offer method that precedes building the funnel. Can you develop a sales funnel before you have a hook and also a tale? Yes. However you may have problem gaining traction, particularly if you’re competing in a red sea. Red oceans are entrepreneur-infested waters competing for the exact same swimming pool of customers, whereas blue oceans are a location where couple of entrepreneurs are swimming in. What does that tell you? Invest the time responsible and the story. Yes, the deal is additionally crucial. However it’s the hook and also the tale that’s mosting likely to reel potential customers in. For example, Brunson used the narrative of fit-to-fat-to-fat owner, Drew Manning. Manning, who remained in fantastic form, went out there and got a bunch of weight over a 6 month duration to much better understand what it seems like to be fat. However after that he headed out there as well as shed all the weight. That right there is an amazing hook as well as tale. It’s one-of-a-kind. And also, because of that, Manning has experienced a meteoric increase, even though his deal isn’t that great. But when the hook and also the story is just so excellent, the deal is nearly unimportant. Successfully, you can sell practically anything when the hook and the tale simply crush it. Another instance is the story of Robert Allen that would constantly state he can be decreased in any type of city in the country as well as get a house no money down within 60 days. Which’s exactly what he did. His brand has corrected a billion bucks in sales due to it. Those are all wonderful hooks as well as stories. Without that, your offer will struggle. If you can think of a distinct means to create your hook and also story, the remainder will form. Since there is a lot red sea out there, this is probably among the most vital indicate make prior to you introduce any kind of sales funnel. Tripwires are fantastic low-barrier-of-entry items that make leads use their bank card. Commonly, these are too-good-to-pass-up products that are offered at an unbelievable price. Just think about the tripwire offered by Columbia House or Sports Illustrated, for instance. Tripwires assist make it less complicated to obtain new clients, and then to rise them up your worth ladder. Anything that makes consumer procurement harder, such as a pricey services or product out of eviction, is going to make expanding and also scaling your business more difficult. The truth is that it costs 5 times as much to draw in a brand-new client as it does to maintain an existing one. That’s why tripwires are so effective. They lower the barrier-of-entry into your organisation. And anything that can lower the obstacle of access is always optimal. An additional great method to release a sales funnel as well as conveniently boost your revenue whatever business you remain in is with a lead magnet. The lead magnet needs to include actual worth. Yet it can be in numerous styles such as a PDF ebook, list, rip off sheet and more. After the download, you can provide an one-time offer. This implies a three-step funnel. You might also produce an up-sell if they take the single offer and even a payment-plan down-sell if they reject it. Why do a lead magnet with lots of value? First, you’re setting on your own up as a specialist. If that web content is genuinely workable, as well as it includes an enormous amount of worth to the prospect’s life, then they’re mosting likely to regard you as the authority. But it does something even more than that. It refers micro-commitments. The concept? Get someone to concur to do three small things for you and also the fourth one is immediately an indeed. Among the most effective sales funnels you can develop is based around the webinar. In fact, it was the webinar that saved Brunson’s organisation from personal bankruptcy a number of times. It was a combination as well as end result of understanding that result in the excellent webinar script, which produces the basis for the supreme sales funnel. Some of it originated from Jason Fladlien, while various other items came from in other places in Brunson’s journey. Nevertheless, all that info combined right into the layout of an ideal webinar and also funnel, has actually essentially changed the businesses of countless entrepreneurs who’ve taken their expertise and monetized it with the exponential force of webinars. Building a webinar is among the surest paths to success with a sales funnel. In fact, the webinar funnel is fairly possibly one of the most transformative funnel you might introduce for any kind of business, brand-new or old. One more method to boost your income with a sales funnel is to build a high-ticket training funnel that goes from application to telephone call to close. The application enables you to extract those who aren’t major. As well as, on the call, you can seal the deal. Now, this kind of sales funnel jobs if you’ve already had outcomes with customers. If not, help totally free up until you get results for individuals. Then, gather reviews and make use of those as part of the pitch for the training. Possibly one of the most significant and most prominent sales funnels these days is the free-plus-shipping offer funnel. It makes a wonderful entrance point right into any type of funnel by producing a single deal or up-sell after the deal, comparable to a tripwire funnel. However, the distinction right here is the power of the word complimentary. Yes, tripwires, which are really affordable products or services, function well. Yet there is real power in the word free. Actually, individuals will certainly raise as well as down for a cost-free offer, even if they need to cover the shipping as well as handling, as opposed to taking a deal that they even have to pay a tiny amount of money for.

“Is she going to be able to tell her side?” Joy Behar exclaimed. The View’s Meghan McCain single-handedly derailed a segment Tuesday when she flipped the subject from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s (D-NY) concerns about child-bearing amid climate change to late-term abortion and “infanticide.” And once the topic was changed, she refused to let her co-host Sunny Hostin get a word in edgewise, prompting a rebuke from her colleague. segment, took that opportunity to spotlight Sen. Ben Sasse’s (R-NE) Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act that was blocked in the Senate Monday. Noting that the bill would punish any doctor that doesn’t provide health care for a baby born after an attempted abortion, McCain claimed that Democrats “don’t believe a baby born after a botched abortion should receive medical care” as they voted to block the legislation in the Senate. While Hostin attempted to point out that Sasse’s bill was unnecessary as it’s already required for doctors to provide medical care to babies born alive, McCain repeatedly interjected, saying how “disgusting” this was and that the doctors need to be punished. Returning from commercial, Behar provided Hostin the opportunity to make her argument without interruption. Though McCain sat silently during Hostin’s remarks, when done, the former Fox News host made sure to get the last word. “If the Democratic Party wants to be the party of infanticide, that is their choice,” McCain sneered.

Leadership Question #3: How Can You Keep Inspiration Alive? Continuing in my series of “20 Leadership Questions,” we come to the third question that Michael Smith asked when he interviewed me. This is one that every leader inevitably faces as his organizations grows. We’ve all experienced it: the large bureaucracy where where the employees seem to be just punching the clock. Last week, I had to get my drivers license renewed. This meant a trip to the Department of Safety’s Driver Service Center. While the process was quicker and more efficient than I expected, the people working the counter seemed lifeless. No smiles. No warmth. Just marking time. It was a little depressing. However, this happens in the private sector as well. In fact, it happens any time people get disconnected from the their purpose. Connect people to the larger story. People want to know that their organization matters. They want to know it is making a difference in the world. For this to happen, you must connect them to the larger story. Why was your organization founded? Why does it exist? What would happen if it disappeared? What is really at stake? Resist creating new policies. I have seen this over and over again in organizations. Someone makes a mistake. Rather than dealing with the problem—which is likely an exception or an anomaly—the leaders create a new policy. Over time, these policies slow an organization down, like the ropes that rendered Gulliver immovable. The better tactic is to deal with problems and people head-on and only institute a policy if the behavior happens repeatedly or spreads beyond the original situation. While there may be a tendency for your organization to become more bureaucratic as it grows, this is not inevitable. However, it does take a leader who is determined to inspire himself and then inspire others. Question: What do you do to actively inspire those who follow you?

How Can I Get Read At A Group Reading Event? How Can I Improve My Chances of Getting Read at a Psychic Group Reading? My group reading are what I love doing the most. It’s so great to have personal interaction and meet so many of you up close and personal. Most people come to group readings hoping to hear a message from their loved ones, and sometimes people are disappointed when they don’t receive a direct message. Some people do the strangest things they think will help them get a reading. At every event it amazes me how some people come hours early to be first in line and rush to the front row seats in hopes of “being seen” by those in Spirit. People bring their loved one’s belongings, memorabilia and even ashes. One woman even brought her husband’s glass eye! People try all kinds of things to get a message. But does any of that really work? When you come to a reading don’t worry about where you are in the room, it doesn’t matter where you sit. If your loved one has a message, that message will find you. I have had messages for people sitting at the back of a room as often as I’ve had them for people at the front. The important thing is to come to the event with an open heart and a positive attitude. That is why I treat every seat at my event like the front row. Each event is a group experience, and every seat is a good seat. I might get pulled to the way back corner to deliver a message to a mother who lost her son. Later, I may be pulled to the middle of a row to talk to a woman who lost her sister. Going in, I never know where the messages will be going, all I know is to listen and follow the direction of Spirit. When your loved one has a message for you, that message will come when the time is right. Messages from Heaven don’t always come when we want them to or when we think they should. The messages come when we need them to and when we are supposed to receive them. Remember that time doesn’t matter, If your loved one passed recently, that doesn’t make it any more likely you will hear from them. Many times, It can be the ones that passed years ago that come through the strongest. If you don’t get a message during a reading, that doesn’t mean your loved one doesn’t want to talk to you. It might just mean that isn’t the right setting, and they will reach you in some other way. Keep in mind that sometimes it can take up to a years time for a loved one to come through with a message. Not all the time, but sometimes it might take a little longer to hear from that special someone. This doesn’t mean they are not with you, it just means they are waiting for the perfect moment. Spirit will only deliver a message when you are ready to hear it and when it will help bring you happiness, comfort and joy. Your belongings don’t help when it comes to receiving a message at a group reading. Your loved ones are connected to you. To your loved ones in Heaven, memories and the soul connection you share are much more important than any physical objects. The physical objects are great for helping you feel the connection, but they aren’t necessary to your loved ones. Bring them if they make you feel good, but remember the connection is in your heart, not in your hands. Sometimes you might attend an event hoping to hear a message from your mom, but your dad comes through instead. It depends who has a message. You might even get a message from someone you don’t like or didn’t even want to hear from. Sometimes an ex-husband will come through with a message to apologize for bad behavior. It’s so important to keep an open mind and be receptive to whatever comes your way. A group reading can be a great way to learn about the ways your loved ones try to communicate with you. Remember that they are learning how to communicate in this new way just as much as you are. They might come in a way you aren’t expecting, even through someone else’s reading! I have had many people tell me that even when they didn’t receive a message, the feeling of connectedness and hope of being part of a group reading lifted their spirits and gave them hope. The saddest thing I see is when someone comments on Facebook and says they won’t come to a group reading because they are not “guaranteed a reading”. I have to shake my head at that. Even during private one-on-one appointments I cannot guarantee that the certain loved one you want to hear from will come through. No Medium can say that for certain. When I channel a message it is a request from the other side, and it is Spirit who makes the decision on whether they decide to speak. As the old saying goes ” you never know unless you try”. When you attend a group reading, your loved ones see it as an opportunity to reach you and speak to you. If there is a message waiting for you that you need to hear, they will make sure that it gets delivered to you. At a group reading I don’t pick the people, those in Spirit do. I just am the messenger waiting for the next message they need me to deliver. I hope to meet you at an upcoming group reading. My team & I have been working hard to add new cities states and locations each week. If there is one thing I can leave you with it’s that each event is so much more that just a show. It is literally a family reunion with Heaven. I hope you will take a look at my upcoming tour schedule by clicking here. Each is a two hour experience where I will be delivering as many messages as possible. There might just be a message waiting for you! Matt I LOVED reading this. It reminded me of the first time I came to see you. I remember packing up all of my mothers things and demanded her to come through to you on the way to your event. I was devastated when I came and got nothing. After a few days I calmed down and decided to try again. I had realized I had been acting selfish. So many people in the room had a far greater loss than I did. I waited a few months until you were in town and I booked my tickets. This time I came with nothing but an open heart and mind. Guess what? She came through ! I was so happy, shocked and emotional. It was the perfect message at the perfect time. Thank you. This happened to me. I came to your show wanting to hear a message from my father, but my brother came through instead. I was so shocked I couldn’t speak. We never had a good relationship and had been estranged for quite some time. His wife didn’t even tell me he died! I found out in the newspaper obituary. When he came through all I could think about was my Dad. I couldn’t process the message at the time because it wasn’t who I wanted to hear from. When I got home all I could do was cry. For once, the grief had left me and your words from him sunk in. I had been carrying a big burden of guilt that I buried deep inside myself. It was your message that healed me. I will always be grateful. I came to your show a while back with my Mom and my daughter-in-law. My Dad came through, you spoke to my Mom with his message. I have absolutely no doubt that it was him. You knew how he died and you also knew things about him and my Mom that I didn’t know until that night. Their love was a beautiful and undeniable thing to see when he was alive. A life together that lasted over 60 years. It was so reassuring to see it live on even after death. I had hoped so much that I would hear from my late husband that night but it was my Dad instead. He carried the message that he was okay and he was whole, happy, and well. He also let her know that he knew and appreciated all she did for him. The message was for her from him but it also put me at peace that my husband was also well, happy and okay. Thank you! Matt I have come to many of your shows. You read my twice! I will never forget how special those moments/ readings were. Now, I make sure that I am at every event when you are in my area. I feel that if I am there, it gives my loved ones an opportunity to connect with me. Even when I don’t receive a message, I leave feeling renewed. Matt, I absolutely LOVE coming to your group readings. Each time you come to town I get a group of girl together and we get tickets. Each time we have come, someone in our group has gotten a reading. We go to dinner after the show and talk about it over wine. It is amazing to be part of each experience. Dear Matt, I would love to come to the group reading. Matt I cannot go to your reading I would love to go but I live in Spain I had a reading about 14 years ago before I moved to Spain I could smell flowers around me and my father came through with an very important message to me which I believe saved my life I was seated at the back of the church God Bless. I am praying that I get read when I see you in June I have positive thoughts you will send some peaceful messages from my Husband who I need to hear from. I know if I do I will be so relieved. Thank you and see you in June it’s a birthday gift from my sister and hopefully a message will be a gift from him.. I laughed when you said “Hello!!!!! Wake UP!” It wasn’t my row that was standing….but the “Horses…..Judy” you were looking around for was for me. Judy saved my life……with a connection to horses……many years go. I didn’t know she had passed, but I did the math and realized it must be so….I should have raised my hand I guess. I just thought (this can’t be for me!) but it was. Thanks. totally unexpected. This will be my first experience at a group reading. As someone with a gift I am truly looking forward to seeing how this is done. I do readings for friends but can never get any information that connects to my own life. I am a skeptic of my abilities but have had many people tell me there is no way I should know the things I do. I know I am not a medium, more of an empath I guess. Anyways looking forward to this experience very much. Thank you so much Linda for the great reply. I am also a true believer in everything happening for a reason. The day my Mother and I are seeing Matt is my deceased Grandmother’s 90th birthday. I am on the edge of my seat to see whst this journey has in store for me! I was at one of your events a few nights ago in New Hampshire. What I began to realize was you connected to people who really needed to hear your messages at this time. You brought comfort and answers to so many people. Thank you for your kindness and compassion you showed everyone. You are a remarkable young man to share such an emotionally draining gift with so many. I will keep you in my prayers for your continued health and happiness. Love to you and yours.

This detox/reboot happened while Thriving Wives was only a distant dream, so I decided to share our journey with friends and family via email. Now that TW is a dream come true, I wanted to share it with you. I have broken it down into daily installments to make reading a little easier, I hope you enjoy the juicing journey as much as we did! Right now is a perfect time to try a juice 'cleanse', since the holidays can leave us all feeling a little more bloated than we'd like. In fact, this actually took place after the holidays last year! Make sure to check out our previous posts on how I got started with juicing, here and here! Let me start by saying, this choice to do a 10-day detox is and never was for weight loss. It is more to cleanse our bodies and give them all the nutrients they need, and as Joe Cross says, "to reboot". After watching my mom successfully shed weight and feel great on her own juicing journey, I was intrigued. As children often do, I needed to hear it from someone else before I was REALLY ready to give it a try. So, with an ever-present push from my momma, I watched the documentary, Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead. Needless to say, I loved it and was more ready than ever to listen to my mom! I did a little research of my own and read some critiques just to make sure I had a well rounded understanding of what juicing was all about. I decided, I wanted IN! I watched her juice at home over my winter break with her Breville Juicer and even drank juice throughout a few days with my mom; only breaking at dinner for a healthy whole-food plant based meal. But, after the holidays I felt I really wanted to "reboot" and wanted TH to do the same. So, I talked him into giving the movie a try and used my rhetoric skills to persuade him into juicing for 10 days. We ordered a juicer and waited anxiously as our new stainless steel beauty traveled to our home. Once she arrived, we quickly went to our local fruit and veggie stand and purchased $30 of fresh, locally grown and organic fruit. Our bounty included: One box of apples, two pineapples, a large bag of oranges, 12 kiwis, 3 mangoes and six cucumbers. Then it was on to a locally owned market to get the veggies. $9 later we were out the door with: 2 heads of kale, 1 head of green lettuce, 3 beets, 12 carrots and 2 heads of swiss chard. We were pumped and ready to start our 10 days of juicing! Thank you for commenting! Not only was it a great idea, it felt great too! Thank you for commenting! Isn't juicing just the best? I love how it can always make me feel refreshed and super healthy! I have always wanted to try juicing! Looking forward to hear how it goes ;) Nice to meet your blog! If you are interested in trying then this journey is just what you've been looking for. I always tell my new juicing buddies to start with the film. Check out my previous posts for more info! Nice! Sounds amazing actually! Love this. If there is one thing I love more than juice it is NYC! I am sure you have tons of killer juice bars. I will be heading out for my annual trip this June and will get a great list going for all our East Coast readers! Thanks for sharing this journey. And I'm totally jealous that you were able to get your TH on board. Mine would roll his eyes and tell me I'm crazy. And a path like that one is always better with a friend. I'm excited to read more! I think we have your next 30 day challenge...getting your TH on board for a juicing detox!!! You can just tell that little sweetie of yours, to pick those eyes right up off the floor and man up! What, he can't handle a little challenge? Ha! I remember vividly mind manipulating my TH and making it sound like I was sure he couldn't do it. I mean, come on...10 whole days of nothing but juice, there was NO WAY!...sure enough he didn't like that doubt one bit and rose to the occasion. Keep reading an hopefully get some tips on how to get him on board. Good luck! Hey this is awesome. I just found this post and can't wait to start readng it and find out how your journey went. I think a "reset" or cleanse a couple of times a year is awesome. I've done it myself and always feel good afterwards. It breaks old habits and starts new one's. Thank for taking time and posting your results. Best wishes and juice on! Thank you so much for stopping by! I am so pleased to see you too are a part of the "juicing community" and also reap the rewards only juicing can give you. Enjoy!

Families, Divorce and Voter Turnout in the U.S. How large a role does the family play in civic development? This paper examines an important aspect of family influence by tracing the impact of divorce on voter turnout during adolescence. We show that the effect of divorce among white families is large, depressing turnout by nearly 10 percentage points. Using data from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988, we demonstrate that the impact of divorce varies by racial group and can rival the impact of parents’ educational attainment, which is generally regarded as the most important non-political characteristic of one’s family of origin. We attempt to explain the divorce effect by examining the mediating impacts of parental voter turnout, active social learning, income loss, child–parent interaction, residential mobility, and educational attainment.

Purpose of reviewThis review describes the current state-of-the-art with respect to the modification of red blood cells for creating quality controls for use in immunohaematology.Recent findingsThe author has identifed five technologies able to create modified red blood cells potentially suitable for use in quality control. Two of the technologies use enzymes, glycosidases or glycosyltransferases, to modify red blood cells and create ABO quality control cells. A third technology uses polyethylene glycol to reduce antigen expression by masking epitopes, whereas a fourth technology is speculative and involves the in-vitro generation of genetically modified erythroid cells. None of these four technologies are in routine use to make commercially available quality controls. A fifth commercially available technology creates quality controls by adding synthetic blood group A and B antigens (FSLs) to group O red blood cells, creating what are referred to as ‘kodecytes’. This technology is also being used to add blood group peptides onto red cells for use in the future in a range of diagnostic applications.SummaryTransducing cell-derived erythroid populations with blood group encoding or silencing vectors, and the use of FSLs to create kodecytes, are two technologies with the potential to provide quality controls for laboratory use.

Just Heart is an Atlanta based non-profit dedicated to helping families with hospitalized children. Have you ever watched a family member or close friend go through a medical crisis with their child? Have you ever seen a financially responsible family barely making it because of the medical needs of their child? It is heartbreaking. Help hardworking, responsible families get back on their feet. Open your heart and be the miracle in someone's life. It’s a beautiful thing! Just Heart Foundation is dedicated to helping families in crisis, particularly those with a hospitalized child. While government programs exist designed to assist certain demographics, not every family qualifies. Frequently medical bills are covered, but there are no subsidies for living expenses. Just Heart can help with a mortgage payment, utility bills, a car payment or in some other appropriate way. Through such actions, a deserving family can be rescued from the brink of financial disaster. When a family receives assistance from Just Heart Foundation, they join our family by making a pledge. The pledge shares the beauty of giving with the families we assist. When they are able, recipient families are encouraged to make a pay-it-forward pledge to raise funds for Just Heart Foundation. These funds will serve another family in the future, ensuring that the giving process will continue indefinitely. Just Heart Foundation partners with children's hospitals. Families that cannot qualify for government assistance may apply for a Just Heart Foundation grant through the hospital. If you or someone you know are interested in applying for a grant, please contact your hospital social worker or case manager. In the coming months, applicants will be able to quickly see if they qualify for a grant on this site. If they qualify, an application will be sent to them via email. This will be beneficial for families that do not have a social worker or are no longer dealing with their social worker. If your current hospital is not yet affiliated with Just Heart Foundation, have them contact us for further information. Our mission is to provide assistance to families in crisis,--particularly those with a hospitalized child-- by paying their mortgage or rent, utilities, or in some other appropriate way. Our families are encouraged (not required) to pledge to raise funds, when they are able, to help other families.

Revere the Emperor! Expel the Barbarians! Revering the emperor and expelling the barbarians became a national priority after Commodore Perry's black ships forced The Opening of Japan in 1853. The populace was not only dismayed that barbarians were coming in and dictating the terms of their treaties, but that the impotent Tokugawa Shogunate was bending over and giving in to all their demands. But this turned out to be the zenith of the sonnô jôi movement, since the Western powers responded by demanding heavy reparations and then pulverizing Satsuma capital Kagoshima when they weren't forthcoming. While this incident served to further weaken the shogunate, permitting the rebel provinces to ally and overthrow it in the Meiji Restoration, it also clearly showed that Japan was no match for Western military might. Not that the leadership had ever been particularly serious about expelling barbarians, Satsuma in particular had at the same time happily bought guns, artillery, ships and technology from the West. So after the tennô had been raised to a sufficiently sonkei-able position, the slogan was quietly dropped and replaced with another: 富国強兵 fukoku kyôhei, or "rich country, strong military", the rallying call of Japan's wildly successful Meiji Era and the seed of its megalomania during World War II.

The League for a Workers’ Republic (LWR) was a Trotskyist organisation in Ireland. […] It was founded in 1968 by members of the Irish Workers’ Group, which was mainly centred on Irish emigrants to Britain and was itself the result of a previous split in the Irish Communist Group between those, such as Brendan Clifford, who leaned towards Maoism and went on to form the Irish Communist Organisation (ICO), later the British and Irish Communist Organisation (BICO), and those such as Peter Graham, Sean Matgamna (John O’Mahony) and Gery Lawless who were Trotskyists. The LWR was begun by members unhappy at the low level of activity of that organisation in Ireland and the fact that the IWG leaders were based in London. According to D.R. O’Connor Lysaght in his Early History of Irish Trotskyism, the League for a Workers Republic was formed in March 1968. Those involved in its foundation included Sean Matgamna, Peter Graham, Paddy Healy, and Liam Daltun. It arose out of a split within the Irish Workers’ Group. The LWR soon became a strong force within the Dublin Young Socialists. Early members of the LWR included Carol Coulter, Basil Miller, and Dermot Whelan.

The first edition of the Astrobiology Primer was published in 2006 providing a comprehensive introduction to the field. Sponsored by the NAI, the Primer was spearheaded by editor-in-chief Lucas Mix, and represented the work of graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and countless contributors. Intended as a reference tool, it provided information in 7 topics: Stellar Formation and Evolution, Planetary Formation and Evolution, Astrobiogeochemistry and the Origin of Life, Evolution of Life Through Time, Planet Detection and Characterization, Diversity of Life, and Science in Space. You can download a copy of the 2006 primer here. Revised in 2016, the second edition of the Primer contains revised content that addresses the definition of life in scientific research, the origins of planets and planetary systems, the evolution and interactions of life on Earth, habitability on worlds beyond Earth, the search for life, and the overall implications of the research. The Primer is intended to be a resource for early-career scientists, especially graduate students, who are new to astrobiology. However, the publication can serve as a resource for anyone seeking to understand the framework of the field. Download the new 2016 primer here.

The Eye of the Needle Pose is a gentle hip opening pose, that can be used as an alternative for the deeper hip openers in Yin Yoga, like the Sleeping Swan Pose, Shoelace Pose, or Square Pose. However, it is truly a pose unto itself. Whenever you find yourself unable to perform a strong hip opening pose, the Eye of the Needle is the pose to turn to! If you are a yoga teacher and find that one of your students are unable to the more intense hip opening poses, offer them them the Eye of the Needle as a modification! It is a more gentle hip opening pose, but still carries the same benefits as the more intense ones. If you have sciatica, this pose, is perhaps the single most important pose to relieve it! This is another amazing benefit of this most simple pose. The Eye of the Needle Pose is not specifically a Yin Yoga pose, according to the Yin Yoga experts, so it does not have a name just for the Yin Yoga practice. However, this pose easily lends itself to the yin yoga techniques. Please read specifically about how Yin Yoga differs, when you go to my page, "What is Yin Yoga?" This will give you a solid background on the subject. I love Yin Yoga, because in my experience there is nothing to balance and deepen your personal yoga practice more! Lie down on your mat or carpet with your knees bent and pointing toward the ceiling. Center yourself by becoming conscious of your breathing. Notice your breath for about a minute or so. You may feel a slight pull on your left hip. If you don't, it will be safe to take this pose deeper, because you are able to tolerate the external rotation of your hip. If you do feel an appropriate pull that is only mildly uncomfortable, stay in this position for the length of the pose, from 3-5 minutes on this side. If this starting position is too intense in your hip, slide your right foot farther out, straightening your right leg more (not shown), until you find a spot that you can comfortably hold, with a milder sensation. This is your pose. If you hold it for a minute or so and you find your hip opening and releasing, slide your right foot back up, to where you feel more of a pull again. When you do a Yin Yoga pose, try to use as little muscle effort as possible. Instead, relax your abdomen, shoulders, head and neck as much as you can. The sensations of the pose is targeted on the hip, not the abdomen, neck or shoulders. Avoid crunching up with your abdomen. If after performing the second step of the Eye of the Needle pose in the second picture, you find that you have even more room in your hip, you can take your hands and thread them through your legs even farther, to grasp your right shin, like pictured below. Don't forget to also work on the opposite, right hip, by crossing your right leg! It will be interesting to notice when you switch your legs, how the open hip feels different from the one you have not worked on. Then, when you go into the opposite side, notice if this side is harder to open than the other. Most often, this is the case, that you are not entirely balanced! Hold the opposite side for 3-5 minutes, the same amount that you did on the other side, so that you work on both sides equally. Remember, that when you are performing a yoga pose in the Yin style, that you are exerting no effort of the muscles. Relax everything except the muscles that are required to hold the pose, and then soften those muscles as well for the minimum possible exertion. The target area, in this pose is the hip joint. The long, slow holding of the pose, with a total release of the surrounding muscles allows for the deeper stretch of the joints, tendons, ligaments and fascia. This type of work allows for the deeper opening for a more lubricated and functional joint. A joint that moves into the future in a more adaptive and youthful state. A joint that is free of immobility and therefore injury! The Eye of the Needle Pose is one of self-acupressure on the Gallbladder and Liver meridians. Stimulating these meridians are very important for the health of your emotions, muscles and tendons. Finally, with the length of the yin pose, you can work on your inner methods of meditation, including breath work. Finding an even, balanced breath is the first step for more advanced forms of pranayama, or breath work. Take this time to go inward and concentrate on your breath. When your mind wanders with thoughts for the future or the past, return your attention to your breath. If you can stay focused on only your breath for a full 3-5 minutes while you hold a pose, you are mastering the art of meditation and are staying in the present moment! When this happens, a whole new world of insight becomes a possibility! If you add intent for healing through belly breathing, even more health can be yours. May your Yin Yoga practice be enhanced by the gentle, hip opening Eye of the Needle Pose! May you always be in the moment, body, mind and soul!

Investment-linked insurance policies (ILPs) have both a life insurance and an investment component. Find out how ILPs work and what you should know if you are considering whether to buy one. ILPs combine life insurance coverage and investment. Investment returns are based on the sub-fund’s performance, so you need to select one that meets your investment objectives and risk profile. You bear the full investment risk, there are no guaranteed returns. Insurance charges are paid for by the investment portion of the ILP. Such charges rise with age and there is a risk that your units may not be enough to pay for them. Investment-linked insurance policies (ILPs) are policies that have life insurance coverage and investment components. Your premiums are used to pay for units in one or more sub-funds of your choice. Some of the units purchased are then sold to pay for insurance and other charges, while the rest remain invested. ILPs provide insurance protection in the event of death or if included, total and permanent disability (TPD). Depending on the policy, the death or TPD benefit may comprise the higher of the sum assured or the value of the units in the sub-fund at that point in time or some combination of the two. The value of these units depends on their price, which in turn depends on the sub-fund’s performance. This is why ILPs usually do not have any guaranteed cash values. Some consumers value ILPs because of their flexibility. You can change your investments by switching sub-funds when your financial needs change. In addition, you may also top up your investments and make partial withdrawals. Most regular premium ILPs give you the flexibility to vary the insurance coverage as your needs change. For example, you can reduce the coverage (subject to a minimum sum assured) or even increase it (subject to underwriting). But if you are only concerned about getting insurance coverage, an ILP may not be the most suitable product for you. Single-premium ILPs – You pay a lump sum premium to buy units in a sub-fund. Most single premium ILPs provide lower insurance protection than regular premium ILPs. Regular premium ILPs – You pay premiums on an on-going basis. Regular premium ILPs may allow you to vary the level of insurance coverage you need. Some ILPs may be categorised as Specified Investment Products (SIPs). Do check with your financial institution whether the product you are considering is an SIP. The investment strategy of an ILP is determined by your selection of the sub-funds. This is unlike whole life or endowment policies where the insurer determines the investment strategy. Since an insurer will normally provide you with a range of sub-funds to choose from, it is important that you understand the sub-fund’s investment strategy and approach, as well as the potential risks. If you don't need the insurance coverage, you may consider unit trusts and exchange traded funds (ETFs) instead. Choose one of more sub-funds that suit your investment objectives and time horizon. Some sub-funds offer greater potential for higher returns but come with an increased risk of financial losses. On the other hand, other sub-funds (such as cash sub-funds), may be expected to yield more modest returns in exchange for relatively lower risks. For all ILP sub-funds under the CPF Investment Scheme, the CPF Board will assign a risk classification. Do note that these risk classifications only serve as a very broad guide on whether the sub-fund is suitable for you. ILPs allow you to move your money from one sub-fund to another. This is known as fund switching. It may be helpful for you to consider this if your financial circumstances or risk appetite have changed and you no longer find your current sub-fund suitable. Most insurers offer a limited number of free switches and charge a nominal fee per switch thereafter. Before switching from one sub-fund to another, check whether you are entitled to free switches and if not, how much you would need to pay for the switch. While you are paying the same monthly premium throughout the life of the policy, the cost of insurance typically increases year on year (as you get older the risk of death, disability and illness increases). This is even if you maintain the same coverage (i.e. sum assured). This means that more units may be sold to pay for the insurance charges, leaving fewer units to accumulate cash value under your policy. If you have a combination of high insurance coverage and a poorly performing sub-fund, the value of your units may not be enough to pay the insurance charges. You will have to top up your premium or reduce the coverage. If protection is your main goal, other products such as term insurance, may offer higher coverage at a lower cost. The returns are not guaranteed. The value of an ILP depends on how the sub-funds perform. Do not rely on the past returns of a sub-fund as an indication of its future performance. Insurance charges rise with age. Your units may not be enough to pay the charges. For regular premium ILPs, insurers may also increase the cost of insurance coverage, if there has been a sustained rise in claims. If so, any increase would be applied to an entire class of policies and not just to an individual policy. ILPs usually do not have any guaranteed cash values. Hence, you can potentially lose the entire value of your investment. ILPs are better suited for those with a longer investment horizon to ride out market fluctuations and defray initial costs which can significantly limit short-term potential returns. The insurance coverage between ILPs differ. Some are more investment-oriented with very little insurance coverage, whilst others will allow you to set the level of coverage that you require. Do note that the more you are covered for, the more units will be needed to pay for the coverage and that leaves less units to be invested. Do consider whether you can keep up with the premiums if you no longer earn an income. Do compare investing through an ILP against investing in other investment products. In some cases, the sub-fund that you are interested in may also be offered as a unit trust (i.e. without insurance coverage). If insurance protection is your main goal, then you may wish to consider other insurance options. Read your ILP statements, which your insurer will send to you at least once a year (or more frequently). This statement shows the value of units in the policy, transactions for the period and charges paid through the sale of units. Do review this statement to check if the ILP and sub-funds selected continue to suit your needs. Seek advice if your circumstances and what you need have changed. You can use your CPF savings to buy an ILP if the ILP is included under the CPF Investment Scheme (CPFIS). The CPF Board assigns a risk classification which serves as a broad guide to all ILP sub-funds under CPFIS.
Banks usually do not require a letter to obtain a personal loan, but other financial institutions require a letter. Writing a letter wherein you ask for a loan is not a difficult task though a few guidelines should be followed. The letter needs to mention your loan and then also mention your capability to repay the loan. The bank only needs to know your reason for applying for the loan and how you would repay the debt, nothing else. If you have benefited from the services of this bank in the past, then you can mention that in your letter. If you have an account in this particular bank, you must mention that as well. Before issuing a loan, the bank needs to know you are already a valuable part of the bank. Only then it will be convinced to give you the loan. If you have some accounts in this bank and do a great deal with it, then the bank will have the preference for you than another person who is seeking for a loan to this company. First and foremost it is vital to mention the reason for asking for a personal loan. The wordings of the letter should be polite enough to support your request. Use our free Sample Request Letter for a personal loan to help you get started. I would like to bring to your kind attention that I have recently submitted documents for the _____________________________. I would need a personal loan to make the payment for the same. I am enclosing all the documents for your reference pertaining to _______________. I would be very thankful to you if you could arrange the loan at the earliest as I am a account holder in your branch. My account no. is ____________. I look forward to having a prompt action from you regarding this matter. Please feel free to call me regarding any clarifications. Given below is a sample for writing a request for personal loan letter. I would like to bring to your kind attention that I am holding a saving account in your bank, my account no. is 34521. My son has applied for the management course in one of the best universities in London, and he has cleared the entrance of the same. Massive investment is involved in his admission. Therefore, I am in need of a personal loan of $30000 for the same. I am enclosing all the relevant documents for the application of loan. Hope you will consider our request on a top priority basis and arrange a personal loan for us at the earliest. It is a matter of my son’s future. I look forward to having a prompt action from you regarding this matter. Given below is a sample email for writing a request for loan letter. I will like to mention that I lost these certificates recently and a police complaint has been made in this regard, a copy of which is attached along with this letter. It would be worth mentioning that kindly issue these certificates as soon as possible as I need them to appear for a government exam.
After a meeting of the minds with renown psychologist Albert Bandura, David Kelley sketched out his philosophy of design thinking education. He outlines the details in depth in his book Creative Confidence and in his 2012 TED talk. This poster presents a summary of that philosophy. Prepared for a talk and painted by hand in David's home studio, it is a map of the d.school pedagogy and a high-level treatise on how to unlock creative confidence in his students. The real goal of the d.school is to give students creative confidence, an idea similar to what Bandura calls “self-efficacy:” the ability to do what one sets out to do, in her own way, even while facing ambiguous circumstances. The core trait that holds people back is fear: fear of failure, fear of being judged. Something about Design Thinking –– that it is human-centered and focused on helping others, or that it thrives on experimentation and small steps –– gives students permission students to try on new behaviors despite the fear.

A TBC must also resist environmental degradation. This may occur as oxidation of the bond coat, phase transformation stress deterioration of the zirconia layer, or chemical destabilization of the oxide layer. The severity of these effects depends on the oxidation resistance of the bond coat, the initial crystalline phase mixture of the zirconia coating, the service temperature, and the environmental impurities present. Bond Coat Oxidation. To test the oxidation resistance of the bond coat and its effect on the spallation of the TBC, a thermal cycle needs to combine extended soak time at high temperatures with periodic heating and cooling cycling to induce thermal stress. One such cycle used to test TBCs for aircraft gas turbine applications is a simple tube furnace that operates at a constant temperature of 1121 °C (2050 °F), with the sample set pneumatically moved in and out of the hot zone. The TBC samples rest on an alumina firebrick boat, with dense alumina pushrods made from thermocouple insulator ceramics, for an all-oxide hot-zone support system. The samples heat to furnace temperature in about 5 min, soak for 50 min, and then are quickly pulled out for a 5 min cooling period. At the end of every 25 cycles, the samples are held out and visually examined at room temperature. After 200 cycles, the samples are inspected for spallation or edge cracking, then are mounted in plastic for evaluation in polished cross section. There the extent of bond coat oxidation and interface cracking can be measured. The test temperature is as much as 110 °C (200 °F) higher than expected for the component in service and is thus an accelerated test for oxidation of the bond coat. To make this comparison test valid, care should be taken that the furnace temperature profile is uniform and covers the full zone occupied by the TBC samples. A cycle for testing coatings for diesel applications can be similarly designed by setting the soak temperature about 110 °C (200 °F) higher than the measured steady-state temperature of the substrate metal of the component in question. In the case of coatings for steel or cast iron substrates, the bond coat is typically not heat treated, which may allow internal oxidation of the Ni-Cr or Fe-Cr-Al-Y alloys used for thermally sprayed layers. Thus, a cycle soak temperature of 650 to 982 °C (1200 to 1800 °F) may still challenge inadequate coating systems. Zirconium Oxide Phase Stability. Pure zirconium oxide is an allotropic material and has a cubic structure from its freezing point at 2680 °C (4856 °F) down to 2370 °C (4298 °F), where it transforms to a tetragonal structure of similar cell size. Because of this small difference in crystalline cell volume, thermal cycling across the cubic-tetragonal transition temperature does not impose severe internal stresses. Following further cooling to below 1170 °C (2138 °F), zirconia transforms to the monoclinic structure, which has about a 4% larger crystalline cell volume than the tetragonal structure (Ref 3). Large internal stresses are generated as the transformation front sweeps through the material, which can lead to crack initiation. Commercially useful zirconia is alloyed with yttria, which has a cubic-plus-tetragonal two-phase field in its phase diagram (Fig. 6) and inhibits the low-temperature tetragonal-to-monoclinic transformation (Ref 3, 5, 6). In thermally sprayed yttria-stabilized coatings, the feedstock is powder, which may be fabricated by a variety of methods (Ref 7). Partially stabilized zirconia, with about 6.5 to 9 wt% Y, mostly avoids the monoclinic phase and the fully stabilized cubic-only phase, which is known to have less thermal shock resistance than the dual-phase cubic-plus-tetragonal structure (Ref 8). A powder feedstock may have the correct average yttria content, but it may not be homogeneous at the crystalline grain level. An inhomogeneous powder may have some local volumes that have no yttria and others with yttria concentrations far higher than the bulk analysis. The x-ray diffraction pattern of such a powder thus shows the monoclinic phase characteristic of the nearly pure zirconia grains, along with tetragonal and cubic phases from the volume of the material that was sufficiently combined with yttria. When an inhomogeneous powder is plasma sprayed to form a coating, the particle melting in the arc improves the degree of homogeneity. However, this may not be sufficient to fully homogenize the material, depending on the state of the starting powder and the chosen spray parameters. where M, T, and C denote the mole percentages of the monoclinic, tetragonal, and cubic phases, respectively, and 7(hkl) is the integrated intensity for the (hkl) diffraction peak. For the high-angle (400) peaks, a deconvolution routine was used first to separate the three overlapping peaks. Not all TBCs need to be made from homogeneous 6 to 9 wt% YSZ. The importance of the degree of homogeneity and the allowable amount of monoclinic phase in the starting powder depend on the maximum temperature to be experienced by the TBC. Consider the zirconia-yttria phase diagram in Fig. 6 in the following argument. Assume that a coating made from inhomogeneous 8% YSZ powder has some fraction of grains of very low yttria content. These grains will behave as if they were a separate entity and experience the phase transitions characteristic of nearly pure zirconia. At room temperature these grains should exist in the monoclinic structure. The other grains may be partially stabilized with yttria and exist mainly as the nontransformable tetragonal phase, and possibly some cubic-phase material. These higher-yttria-content nontransformable tetragonal grains exist as a nonequilibrium phase because of the rapid quench from the liquid state upon deposition at the substrate. They have high thermal fatigue resistance because they will not transform to the monoclinic phase and experience the large volume change. On the other hand, the nearly pure zirconia grains having the monoclinic structure may be safe from transformation stresses as long as they remain below the temperature of the M + T two-phase field, which can be as high as about 1100 °C (2000 °F). Therefore, coated components that have a maximum exposure of only 760 °C (1400 °F) should be stable against deleterious phase transformation, even though they may have a zirconia coating composed of both stabilized and unstabilized grains. As the operating temperature of the component increases, the need for a homogeneous coating increases. Applications at temperatures above about 1100 °C (2000 °F) should require fully homogeneous coatings. For applications at 760 to 1100 °C, thermal cycle testing is needed to determine whether the powder and coating process selected are adequate. If monoclinic-phase material exists in the coating and is tested with flame impingement on the oxide face to temperatures that cycle through the transformation temperature, the surface layer will begin to flake away small particles. Because of the insulating effect of zirconia, the lower layers of the coating would be at a lower temperature and thus remain intact. If the same nonhomogeneously stabilized coating is exposed to a uniform temperature test, the whole zirconia layer could develop cracks, leading to early spallation if the whole layer is cycled through the phase-transformation temperature. Although the use of fully homogeneously stabilized coatings may seem warranted for all applications, regardless of operating temperature, economic considerations argue against this. Fully homogeneous powders, which are more costly, must either be fused and crushed or sintered from pure zirconia and yttria components at high temperatures. If the exposure temperature of the TBC does not demand monoclinic-phase-free material, a less costly powder will still meet the thermal barrier performance required. The key is to know the relation between operating temperature limits and the phase content of the coating. Chemical Effects on Phase Stability. As discussed above, powders that are inhomogeneous in regard to yttria concentration could lead to coatings with phase-transformation-induced cracking if used at high temperatures. It has also been found that fully homogeneous yttria-stabilized coatings used in high-temperature environments containing vanadium and/or sulfur can experience surface degradation. In this case, the impurities can form yttrium vanadate and yttrium sulfide by leaching yttrium from the coating (Ref 5, 9). This leads to a surface layer that is progressively depleted in yttria content, and eventually to a material that is in the fully monoclinic structure when cooled and has a large volume change and disruptive stresses when thermally cycled. This surface transformation can also be detected by x-ray diffraction, which will give the evidence needed to understand the failure mechanism.

Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms last year this time was in the race of her life. She was running for mayor of Atlanta and while many thought she didn’t have a chance, she still pressed on. Mayor Bottoms joined “The Rickey Smiley Morning Show,” to talk about voting as well how things have changed in Atlanta since being elected. Furthermore, she doesn’t want people to get too comfortable with this elections and spoke about how last year nearly 832 votes made a difference in her winning or losing. Mayor Bottoms mentioned that the city of Atlanta has gotten rid of cash bonds, passed a vote for affordable housing and more. She was dedicated to changing things in so many communities and will continue to do so while in office. Lastly, she mentioned that today could possibly be one of the biggest turnouts that Georgia has ever seen and could make history! Check out some photos of Black women running for office below! For too long we've had representatives who aren't concerned with what we have to say or the issues we care about. I'm fighting to change that by running for Congress. We are one step closer to making history. Will you be casting your ballot on November 6?

Get ready for the weekend by creating these frightfully fun cookies with a sweet surprise inside using our Halloween 3-in-1 Surprise Cookie Cutters. Over a small bowl, sift together the flour and salt. Set aside. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the flat beater, beat the butter on high speed until creamy, about 2 minutes. Reduce the speed to medium, slowly add the sugar and beat until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes, stopping the mixer occasionally to scrape down the sides of the bowl. Add the egg and vanilla and beat for 1 minute, stopping the mixer once to scrape down the sides of the bowl. Stop the mixer and add half of the flour mixture. Beat on low speed until most of the flour has been absorbed, about 1 minute. Add the remaining flour and continue beating until all of the flour has been absorbed and the dough starts to pull away from the sides of the bowl, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and let stand for 5 minutes. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough 3/16 to 1/4 inch (4.5 to 6 mm) thick. Preheat an oven to 350°F (180°C). Line several baking sheets with parchment paper. Using the Halloween surprise cookie cutter, cut out a cookie, then press down on the plunger to imprint the detail. If the dough sticks to the cutter, dip the cutter into flour before cutting out more shapes. For every third cookie cut, do not imprint a detail. Instead, turn over the cookie cutter and center the plunger over the cookie. Press down to cut out a hole in the center of the cookie. Using a small offset spatula, transfer the cookies to the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart. Bake the cookies until golden brown around the edges, 12 to 14 minutes. If baking more than one sheet at a time, rotate the baking sheets from top to bottom and 180 degrees halfway through baking. Transfer the baking sheets to wire racks and let cool for 5 minutes, then transfer the cookies to the racks and let cool completely. Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. To assemble, place royal icing in a pastry bag fitted with a small round tip. Place one of the imprinted cookies, detailed side down, on a work surface. Pick up one of the cookies with the center cut out and, using the pastry bag, pipe a line of icing around the edges of the cookie. Adhere to the cookie on the work surface, aligning the cookies’ edges. Place nonpareils or small candies in the recess. Pipe royal icing around the edges of the center cookie and place an imprinted cookie, detailed side up, on top. Align the edges and press to adhere. Repeat the process with the remaining cookies. Decorate as desired. Makes 12 surprise cookies. Salt & Straw Is Open in Los Angeles! Thank you These cookies looks awesome!

ODELL BECKHAM Jr has signed a $95 million (£74 million) five-year extension with the New York Giants, making him the highest paid wide receiver in the NFL. Beckham is guaranteed to earn $65 million over the six seasons that he is now contracted to play for the Giants, but he could pocket a maximum of $95 million. The 25-year-old said: “Honestly, I don’t even know how to explain it...I don’t know if it’s a relief, I don’t know – it’s a combination of everything. You’ve worked all your life to get to this point and it’s finally here. I have to thank Mr Mara, Steve Tisch, Mr Gettleman, coach (Pat) Shurmur, Eli (Manning), all the guys I played with in the past years. Everybody was really a part of this - my mom, my dad, my family, everybody who was supporting me through this. It’s just such an amazing feeling, I can’t even explain. Roger Lewis, Beckham’s teammate was among those congratulating the Louisiana native on the deal.
Congress Is For Sale to the Highest Bidder. Americans of all stripes oppose the militarization of U.S. police forces. A December 2013 Reason-Rupe poll found that 58% of Americans thought that police militarization has gone too far. A new Pew research poll shows that a plurality of people think that the police have gone too far in Ferguson, Missouri. So why does Congress continue to approve militarization? For the same reason that Congress members vote for NSA spying on Americans and go easy on Wall Street criminals: money. The group’s new report looked at a June congressional vote on legislation, offered by U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Fla., that would have blocked the Pentagon from spending resources on transferring military hardware to local police agencies. The bill was defeated 62-355. According to data compiled by Maplight, the lawmakers “voting to continue funding the 1033 Program have received, on average, 73 percent more money from the defense industry than representatives voting to defund it.” In all, the average lawmaker voting against the bill received more than $50,000 in campaign donations from the defense industry in the last two years. The report also found that of the 59 lawmakers who received more than $100,000 from defense contractors in the last two years, only four voted for Grayson’s legislation.
Now, more than ever, this sentiment holds true for me. I could have said these words, because that’s how much I feel them, live them. Just a few years ago I had a dream – to live in New York City, to be a part of it, embrace it, have it envelop me, and ultimately perish to become one with it. The dream came true. I became one with the city, I perished a version of me when New York stripped me of falsities. And then, I found myself. As my perspective changed, so did my beliefs, I learned what my values were, that which made up my core. I became less judgmental, I began to simply get the situation as it was there. Each new story of every new person widened my thought horizon, and I began to see life as I never knew of it. Brooklyn became home, a place where I belonged – it was my place, where I had become unapologetically me. I was now comfortable – comfortable yet yearning – yearning for some change – what it was I did not really know for a long time. My place had now become my comfort zone – and that’s a dangerous place to be in. But it was still my place, it is still my place. I pushed myself to a new journey, of acceptance and gratitude, of self-awareness and purpose, and new dream – to fulfill that purpose. Now I had a why, and that is bigger than every how, what, when, and most importantly where. I opened my eyes to the world, and suddenly it all made sense – the place that I was looking for, that I had tied to New York City, was actually, all along in my mind. It was New York that opened my mind – and once it opened, the answers came flooding in. Who I was, who I wanted to be. What value I brought, what brought value to me. I am now free, not just in dreams but in reality. To my calling I am bound. As long as to my heart, my mind, my purpose, true I stay. Previous PostGrateful Next PostWhat Do YOU Want?
The William Smith Dean’s Office is the keeper of William Smith College’s rich traditions, and the main source of academic support and encouragement for William Smith students. We are a community of intelligent and talented young women joining together to celebrate each other’s many accomplishments, and to support each other. We foster and celebrate the creativity, scholarship, service, leadership, and athleticism of William Smith women, and we work hard to ensure that every William Smith woman receives the guidance she needs in order to succeed academically. William Smith’s intention in founding a women’s college was to provide an educational opportunity that would allow women to live an “abundant life”. The WS Deans coordinate a four year experience that supports his goal. We support the academic mission of the institution as a first priority in students’ lives. The Deans provide students with academic counseling, advising, problem-solving, and recognition. Additionally, because we see how academic policies impact student lives, we advise faculty and administrative bodies regarding the creating and change of academic policies. We promote the development of leadership in various ways. We provide opportunities for students to serve successfully in leadership positions and to understand group dynamics and democratic processes. We believe that since leadership has historically been a male/masculine reality, the importance of supporting separate leadership development opportunities specific for women is paramount. We attempt to provide an experience that will allow women to become more self-aware and to understand and define themselves as members of the WS community, the Geneva community, and the world. Maintaining WS College traditions serves to connect students to the past, present, and future of the College. The traditions encourage students to understand WS College in a historical perspective. This sense of connection to the past promotes connection to the College in the present, thus supporting retention of women, and supports alumnae connection to the College post-graduation.
How Do I Search For a Travel Nursing Job? If yo’ve just begun looking for a travel nursing job, or are even considering travel nursing, it can be a daunting task to do some research. Each agency might have their own contracts with a particular facility and there are literally hundreds of different agencies. More than likely, though, the agency has contracts with one of the vendors who sign agreements with lots of different agencies. Confused? What it really means is that a particular travel nursing job is very likely available from several different agencies. How do you find them? In my business I have taken a different approach. I am Independent of the agencies and have contracts with several different ones and access to most of the major Vendors. What this means to a prospective travel nurse is that I can work closely with a nurse. I find out exactly what he or she is looking for and then do a national search with all of my various sources. Once we locate “the job” we want to target I can then approach the agency and negotiate a package of pay, benefits and tax free reimbursements. The agency/vendor is happy, the nurse is served well and has the added benefit of a professional representation. The agency pays my fee, by the way. If you would like me to do a personal job search for you and give you an idea of just what is out there contact me using the form below. You will not be handed off to a staff member or an inexperienced recruiter. I do this service myself. I can only deal with a limited number of nurses so the sooner you get in touch, the better. I will NOT share your information. How long do I commit to a travel nursing job? Thanks for the question, Kimberly. Travel nursing assignments are normally for a 13 week period, ( 3 months). Some of the travel nursing jobs are available because of a seasonal change in population, (think Florida), so the hospital doesn’t want to staff a permanent employee for that temporary need. More often though the travel nurse jobs are available because the hospital simply cannot find qualified personnel to fill a current need. Consequently, if they are happy with your work and you are happy with the job, you might very well be offered an extension. Extensions are usually for an additional 13 week period. You can maintain your legal status as a traveler, (along with the attendant tax advantages) taking up to 3 extensions in any one location. If you stay more than a year the IRS will likely deem you a local nurse and you will lose a lot of benefits. Once you are about 4 weeks from the end of your assignment I would suggest you get in touch with your recruiter or your Advocate and begin discussing whether you want to extend or whether you would like to look at other assignments. You also may want to take a break and do some pleasure travel. Some of my nurses try to schedule a weeks vacation every 13 weeks! The point is, the decision is yours. TIP:.If you think you may want to take a traveling nurse job in a state other than the one you are currently working in it is a good idea to talk with your recruiter and work on the licensing early rather than wait until a job comes up you want to take but cannot due to licensing. Feel free to contact me for a free consultation on this. Some states take 3 days, some states take 3 months. If you would like to have a personal conversation with me (Conrad) you can request it HERE. Can I take a travel nursing jobs near home? Can you accept travel nursing jobs near your permanent residence? As I understand it, this is really a tax question and I certainly am not a tax professional. Here is what I mean. One of the benefits of taking a travel nursing assignment is that the agency will generally provide you with either fully paid housing or a stipend. It is my understanding that you can receive this money or benefit tax free since you are required to live away from “home” for this job. A lot of people say travel nursing jobs need to be 50 miles from home to qualify for this but I think that is a gray area, as I cannot find any mile requirement when looking it up in the tax code. You really need to ask your tax professional about this but I do think it is pretty clear that you cannot live in your normal permanent residence and receive that money tax free. The one I have checked with (who specializes in travel nurses) says the code basically says that if the job is far enough to need you to stay overnight. I have had nurses who “commuted” to the job from their home base for 3×12 shifts and stayed in motorhomes or Extended Stay America facilities then headed home for the days off. I get asked this quite often. “Can I bring my dog, cat (or?) on a travel nursing job assignment? I used to discourage this. Getting housing that allowed a travel nurse to have a pet could be difficult. It seems that time has mellowed the attitudes towards this though. More and more agencies will work with you and do whatever they can to find you housing that can allow your pet. This is especially true if you are a very qualified candidate for travel nursing and are applying for a job that is more difficult for the travel nursing agency to fill. Now that housing stipends are all the rage and you are arranging your own housing more often than not, it is easier to communicate directly with landlords and “room renters” about this. A lot of nurses rent out rooms to travel nurses and if they are pet owners they are much more likely to allow pets. I have a lot of thoughts on this so if we happen to have a private conversation ask me! So think twice. Everyone’s situation is different. As an aside, I once had two pet rats. They were the best! They loved their cage and even if I left the door open the had no interest in venturing out. They had wonderful personalities (I swear) and were great little companions. Not that I am saying every travel nurse who wants a pet should get a rat but………they will do pretty well when you are working those 10 hour shifts! Just a thought lol. If you would like to talk persoanlly with one of the top travel nurse experts in the country just ask!

The question is deceptively difficult to answer. We are better at measuring time than defining it. Time is measured by movement: sand through an hourglass, the shadow of a sundial, our earth circling the sun. The great white Egret is motionless in the shallow water. Time stands still. But it really doesn’t. Even when we don’t see movement, it’s there – the beating of the Egret’s heart, her eyes watching for an almost imperceptible stirring of the water. The tiny fish swim in front of her, not knowing that she is the predator and they are a mid-morning snack to be snatched out of the water and swallowed whole. Time is like money. Imagine your body is a home you are renting. The rent is withdrawn from a bank account every month. The money in the bank represents the time you have on this planet. You have no way to know how much is in the bank account. You can add funds to the account – regular exercise and healthy eating. You can take money out of the account – smoking, using a daily narcotic, or carrying 100 extra pounds. When the money runs out, you must move. It isn’t helpful to pretend you own the home, or that the bank account is unlimited. Moses made an estimate of how long you’ll get to stay in the rental home – 80 years. I don’t think he was joking when he said “Toil and Trouble”. Everything is touched by sin. Aging, loss, weakness and struggle mark the human experience. And then we die. We serve a God who is outside of time. He existed prior to the beginning of time and will continue into eternity after this universe is no more. Our hope cannot be in our ability to freeze time, to delay the aging process. Our hope is in our Almighty Father who is the owner of the rental home, and the source of every dollar in the bank account. Moses' conclusion is that the path of wisdom is living as though our days are numbered - because they are. Let that free us to joyfully receive each day as a gift from above, regardless of how many are behind or ahead.
Then Jesus began to denounce the cities in which most of his miracles had taken place, because they didn't repent. Then he began to upbraid the cities in which most of his mighty works occurred, because they did not repent. Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not. Then He began to censure and reproach the cities in which most of His mighty works had been performed, because they did not repent [and their hearts were not changed]. Then Jesus began to rebuke the people of the towns where most of His powerful miracles were performed because they did not repent [when they saw Him perform them]. Then he began to reprove the cities in which most of his mighty works had been done, because they did not repent. Then he went on to say hard things to the towns where most of his works of power were done, because they had not been turned from their sins. Then he began to upbraid the towns where most of his miracles were wrought, for their not being converts.

Then He began to upbraid the cities in which were done most of His mighty works, because they did not repent. Then began He to upbraid the cities, in which most of his miracles were wrought; because they did not repent. 19 The son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a glutton, and drinker of wine, and a friend unto publicans, and sinners. And neverthelater, wisdom is justified of her children." 20 Then began he to upbraid the cities, in which most of his miracles were done, because they repented not: 21 "Woe be to thee, Chorazsin! Woe be to thee, Bethsaida! for if the miracles, which were showed in you, had been done in Tyre and in Sidon: they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. But my people would not hear my voice; and Israel would not obey me. Hear O heaven, and hearken O earth, for the LORD hath spoken: I have nourished and brought up children, and they are fallen away from me. "Woe be to thee Chorazsin: woe be to thee Bethsaida. For if the miracles had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in you, they had a great while agone repented, sitting in hair and ashes. For I have looked, and considered: but there is no man that speaketh a good word. There is no man that taketh repentance for his sin, that will so much as say, 'Wherefore have I done this?' But every man, as soon as he is turned back, runneth forth still, like a wild horse in a battle. Hearken now what the LORD sayeth: Up, reprove the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice. The men of Nineveh shall rise at the day of judgment with this nation, and condemn them: for they amended at the preaching of Jonah. And behold, a greater than Jonah is here. He answered him and said, "O generation without faith, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I suffer you? Bring him unto me." After that he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat: and cast in their teeth their unbelief, and hardness of heart: because they believed not them which had seen him after his resurrection. For thou bringest strange tidings to our ears. We would know therefore what these things mean." If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, which giveth to all men indifferently and casteth no man in the teeth; and it shall be given him. And the remnant of the men which were not killed by these plagues repented not of the deeds of their hands, that they should not worship devils, and images, of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and of wood, which neither can see, neither hear, neither go. and blasphemed the God of heaven for sorrow, and pain of their sores, and repented not of their deeds.

The children were asked to take a piece of double sided tape and stick it around an empty glass jar in a spiral motion. Once the backing tape was removed, it left a sticky surface for the children to attach the leaves to the jar. Once they had squeezed on as many leaves as they felt happy with, the adults added the wired twine. I think it may be called Bindwire and used by florists. I found some here from oasisfloral.co.uk. The adults twisted the twine to create a handle for the lantern. The children loved making the lanterns and took them home at the end of the day. I think they look very appealing once they have a candle glowing inside. Magoo and I added some Hydrangea petals to our jar once we were home. In the Autumn the Hydrangeas in our garden turn a beautiful maroon shade. we couldn't resist adding them in amongst the leaves. Oh this is a lovely idea - obvs I am LOVING the use of hydrangea petals! I'll try this with Kit and Ozzy at the weekend - thank you for sharing and the inspiration! Beautiful. I love lanterns and making a leaf lantern is so pretty. These are lovely, and so simple to make as well!

The Calgary Zoo’s new Wildlife Conservation Centre provides hope to endangered species. The facility is dedicated to breeding endangered species for reintroduction into the wild. Your zoo is building a new state-of-the-art Wildlife Conservation Centre to better address the mounting needs for this type of conservation work here in Canada and around the world. Real conservation success is not a short-term venture – it takes time and commitment over decades. The Brian Keating Conservation Endowment provides critical long-term funding to support conservation projects in Canada and around the world. The focus is on the reintroduction of endangered species and empowering local communities to benefit from and protect wild species. Your Calgary Zoo is leading an innovative conservation project to save burrowing owls. This head-starting project involves raising wild young burrowing owls in captivity over their first winter to increase their survival. Fitted with satellite transmitters to track their movement, yearling owls are released the following spring to their Alberta nesting grounds. This project has the potential to benefit the burrowing owl population in Canada by increasing both the survival of young owls and the likelihood that owls will return to their Alberta nesting site every spring―two factors likely influencing their population decline. At the Calgary Zoo, we’re committed to providing the highest quality of animal care. You can join your zoo in providing dynamic habitats and engaging enrichment activities for the animals that live at the Calgary Zoo. You can also assist in providing our animal care, veterinary and conservation research teams with equipment and supplies. As a registered charity, the zoo depends on your financial support. You can specify where you would like your donation to go, or allow us to direct your support where it is most needed. If you want your gift to fund a specific program and don't see it in our drop-down menu, just make a comment in the Message section.

By Madison Montana One advantage of short-selling is that an active investor can be profitable in a rising or falling market environment. In uncertain markets one can use shorting to hedge against long positions. This is particularly beneficial when Political, Market or Idiosyncratic Risk is present in the trading environment. After a trader presses the sell button what actually happens? A trader sell order goes to his/her broker. Then, the broker checks to see if the stock is in the trader’s account. If not, the broker classifies it as a “short-sell.” He then checks his company’s inventory of stocks to short and the subsequent amount of shares available. He identifies shares available either in the company’s inventory or a client account. At which time, he “lends” the shares to the trader and credits his/her account with the revenues from the sale. Now, the trader is “short” the stock. Note: This is laborious in theory, but it is all automated in real-time. Why would you short a stock? You believe that the stock is extended technically or that information is coming (or in existence) that will pressure the stock price and cause investors to take profits on their long positions. Such information could include: an analyst downgrade, bad earnings, tighter industry/government regulations, increased competition, change in management, global or macro conditions which could potentially impact the sector negatively and potentially your position; et’al. Shorting a stock is very risky, and not suitable for all investors, as the market has an upward bias. A stock price could go up forever and could create unlimited liability to the short-seller, exceeding the capital in his/her trading account. Whereas, a trader that employs a long-only strategy caps his loss at the capital in his account. Margin Trading: Short-Selling a stock involves using “borrowed money,” otherwise known as margin trading. If your account slips below the minimum margin level, one will be subject to a margin call and forced to put in more cash or liquidate the position. If a trader does not have the discipline, strict risk management rules, employ stops and a scaling methodology, margin requirements can become quite lofty. An alternative to shorting a stock is the employment of a put option strategy. Using put options achieves the same bias as the short seller, but with defined risk. Using options has seen an increase in volume growth over the past few years. However, employing puts strategies may not be suitable for all, as it has its own set of risks and learning curve. “Short Squeeze” Risk phenomena: This occurs when a stock starts to rise and a large % of the stock’s float is short, the short-sellers will try to cover their positions simultaneously and the pressure of the buy orders forces the stock price to rise quickly to undefined levels. A few examples would be a dividend announcement (as the short-seller is required to pay the dividend), a positive announcement by the company, or a change of sentiment in the stock, sector or market. High frequency, dark pools and algos are real and present in the market and once triggered, they can have a similar effect. Capitulation by the buyers at specific price level. Confirmation of Up Trend Extended on Multiple Time Frames for confirmation – Using longer term time frames for support and resistance levels, and identification of an up-trend that breaks below prior day/week/month lows and makes a new low. Although stocks have the potential to go up forever we have seen several companies file for bankruptcy, leaving their investors holding the ball. Traders that understand the risks involved and the discipline that is required to short sell can make nice profits quickly in a declining market or stock price. Thereby, short-selling is a great tool to have in any trading tool box, to profit when markets are down trending and to hedge long positions in an uncertain market. But, it is risky and requires discipline and an obedience of stops. As stated, this trading strategy requires strong discipline and the ability to assess market conditions in real-time. Risk is elevated when holding a short overnight, so know your time frame. Personally, I enjoy a challenge, as taking on a short, keeps me in the game. Every day, I need to assess the market condition and what are the potential risks that may impact my position. Thanks for reading. About Madison Montana: Manage funds for clients & self.

How does this house get so messy so fast? Maybe I need to reinforce cleaning up toys a bit more with Eli. Or maybe I will wait until he grows up a bit more. Do I have enough time to hop in the shower really quick? At least I can’t really hear the baby crying in there and could have just a 15 minute break. One day I am replacing these white kitchen counter tops with something that hides the dirt. That will be the day. It may be 5 years from now but it will be glorious. If I stayed at home full time, I wonder if I would get continually bitter about cleaning the house, only to see it messed up continually? I wonder what I should try to do today. I could stay in the house cleaning or taking care of the baby all day. I am not sure if that would make me happy. I probably need to sit down and read this morning, even if for two minutes. Try to listen to what God may be telling me. That is about the time I sat down and read the following passage in Ephesians 3:6-11. This passage reminds me that I have been chosen for something more than just being a servant of my house, chores, or even motherhood. I have been chosen to tell people about what God has done for them and myself. To tell them that even though I may be a “useless Christian” that somehow I have been chosen to tell of the joy of the “endless treasures of Christ”. If that is Paul’s mission and vision for his life, I must make it mine too. Imagine if I walked around looking and anticipating the treasures of Christ? I am not sure what that really looks like, but I pray that God would begin to show me little by little, day by day. Next Post What do you thirst for more than God?
With increasing fervor, foreign buyers are flocking to invest in construction and redevelopment projects, also known as value-added projects, rather than simple rental businesses. In fact, across Europe, the proportion of investors opting for value-added projects surged from 22% in 2012 to an astounding 47% in 2016, according to the European Association for Investors in Non-Listed Real Estate Vehicles. This is largely attributable to yields; global yields are declining. In Europe, you can expect an average of 3-7% per annum from a simple rental business. Meanwhile, value-added projects will typically earn you 12-20%. Despite this key advantage, value-added loans can be difficult to pull off due to funding issues. Banks are conservative lenders, and tend to be wary of taking too many risks. As such, it can be difficult get a bank loan of more than 50% of the total project cost. As such, conventional value-added project developers typically cover at least 50% of each project cost out of pocket. However, if a developer lacks the financial freedom to put down this sort of money, their next best bet is to seek investors. 1. Become a mezzanine investor: The investor lends capital to the developer in exchange for a fixed interest for the utilisation of the funds and gets a share in the profits realised from the project. 2. Become an equity partner: The investor provides the developer with equity capital, participates in the project, benefits from operating profits and bears the consequences of the risks inherent to the project. Both of these structures has its own advantages and disadvantages. Mezzanine financing is a hybrid of debt and equity financing. Basically, it is a subordinated debt that has secondary priority after the senior debt – the bank loan. It is secured by a pledge of shares or by equity. The borrower is usually a Special Purpose Vehicle or SPV created by the developer. The main advantage of mezzanine financing from the financer’s point of view is that it tends to offer higher interest rates than bank loans. In the United States, for instance, interest rates typically range between 8-15% per annum. Despite the high rates, developers are willing to use mezzanine loans to get extra financing – typically with the aim of obtaining up to 70% of the project’s value, including the capital obtained from the bank. Doing so enables the developer to reduce the value of their equity in the project and to achieve higher yields, given that in such cases the developer typically only has to come up with 30% of their own funds to finance the project. It also tends to reduce the requirement for earlier stage off-plan sales to boost cash flow. In addition to the increased interest rates associated with mezzanine loans, investors can benefit from extra yields, depending on the profitability of the project. This option is known as an “equity kicker” and is typically structured in the form of one of two types of securities: options or warrants. Compared to simple rental businesses, value-added projects are relatively high-risk; there are significantly more cases wherein participants either fail to earn profits, or even incur losses. At worst, the investor stands to lose all of the capital he or she contributed in the first place. Experienced market players develop a knack for finding projects that will most likely enable them to break even, even if the market situation takes an unfortunate turn. The specific risks associated with value-added projects are numerous: more time spent endeavoring to obtain a construction permit, an increase in the project budget, failure to achieve a sales target, etc. The savvy investor calculates each project’s susceptibility to negative outcomes and evaluates the maximum value by which the price per square meter can decrease or the project execution time can increase before yields will drop to zero. As a rule of thumb, a project that can sustain price decreases of 20% or a project time increase of 20% is probably stable enough for investment. At the same time, the bank and mezzanine investor typically maintain a safe distance from the risk. In most cases, the first to earn nothing under a negative scenario is the developer. It is important to verify this in each case before investing. The developer can choose one of two alternatives with respect to his or her own funds: pay out of pocket or attract an equity partner. An equity partner is an investor who partially finances the project in exchange for a share in the profits. If an equity partner is involved in a project, his or her capital typically comprises about 20% of the project cost. In this scenario, the partner would shares the risks and profits of the project with the developer. In this case, the developer provides the remaining 10% of the project´s cost, showing the equity partner that the project is worth investing in, as the developer also takes on the corresponding financial risks. The developer can also attract the capital of an equity partner without mezzanine financing. Under this scheme, the project is financed by three parties: a bank that provides the primary loan, an equity partner and an investor. As for the distribution of the profits in value-added projects, the order is typically negotiated on a case-by-case basis. For instance, the equity partner may negotiate a priority yield, whereby he or she would be first in line to get a share of the profits to a certain extent, such as 6-8%. In this case, upon passing that threshold, the developer may receive the same yield on the capital he or she injected into the project. The remaining profit may then be distributed progressively between the two; i.e., the higher the project yields, the larger the share of the profit that goes to the developer. For example, it’s common for equity partners and developers to agree that the developer will get 30% of all profits within the yield range of 8-15% per annum, and that anything above 15% would be divided evenly between the pair. In 2017, taking into account the current U.S. and European market situations and the above-mentioned scheme of profit distribution, investors could expect to get 12-20% per annum from value-added projects. In sum, an investor who opts to become a mezzanine lender faces relatively low yields, but also takes on relatively few risks owing to the fact that in the event of bankruptcy, the developer is first to bear losses, followed by the equity partner, with the creditors trailing behind. On the contrary, an investor who opts to become an equity partner stands to earn relatively high profits, but also takes on greater risks. This article only reflects the general principles of the relations between the participants of the developer projects. An investor’s interest in a project can vary broadly depending on the market and the project considered. Moreover, the distribution of risks and yields also depends on the balance of the capital distributed between the developer, mezzanine investor and equity partner. As such, it is vital to seek a professional consultation before pursuing a new value-added project as an investor.

I meant to post this on Monday, but totally forgot seeing how I was running around Northwest Arkansas with my sick bebe. Since Drew went to a Super Bowl part without us sickies, Brayden and I decided we should atleast celebrate together a little. I mean, what's the Super Bowl without some cookies?! So I quickly whipped up a batch of no bake cookies. Please tell me you've had no bake cookies... basically a little bit of heaven (aka lots of butter and sugar) right there for me and B to devour together. He is a big fan of cookies of any variety, and this was his first experience with no bakes. I'm pretty sure he liked them, wouldn't you say? :) (PS-- when he says "cookie" he is signing "cookie". He's gotten really good at saying the word and signing it so that we understand what he is saying).
The study found that the closure of medical marijuana dispensaries is associated with an increase in neighborhood crimes rates. A new study published in the Journal of Urban Economics suggests that medical marijuana dispensaries make the surrounding neighborhood safer. Researchers at University of California, Irvine found that the closure of dispensaries caused about a 12 percent increase in crime in the surrounding area. The findings directly oppose the common misconception that cannabis dispensaries contribute to local crime. The researchers – Jacobson and her research partner, Tom Y. Chang — analyzed the short-term mass closing of hundreds of medical marijuana dispensaries in Los Angeles. In summer 2010, roughly 70 percent of the nearly 600 dispensaries operating in Los Angeles were ordered to close, as the Los Angeles Police Department blamed an increase in crime rate on the influx of cannabis shops. “If these dispensaries truly were crime magnets, we’d expect to see a sharp decrease in crime when they shut down,” Jacobson told The Cannabist. Instead, she and Chang specifically found an immediate increase in larceny, property crimes and auto break-ins in the areas where dispensaries were forced to close as compared to neighborhoods where dispensaries remained open. Within a third of a mile surrounding a closed dispensary, property crimes increased by 12 to 14 percent. At a fourth of a mile out, low-level crimes increased by 14 to 16 percent. Even closer in, at an eighth of a mile, crime jumped 23 to 24 percent once dispensaries closed. Dispensaries appear to positively impact the safety of neighborhoods similarly to restaurants and retail shops. Low-level crimes like vehicle break-ins drop because there are more pedestrians and other bystanders around. Also, dispensaries typically feature security cameras and security guards, which may help to deter crime. “The connection between restaurants and [medical marijuana dispensaries] is that they both contribute to the ‘walkability score’ of a given area. Areas with higher scores have more ‘eyes upon the street’ a factor that is proven to deter some types of crimes,” Jacobson told Science Daily. The study’s findings are consistent with those of prior studies. A study conducted in Denver by Marijuana Policy Project found that crime dropped by 8.2 percent after a dispensary opened in a neighborhood. You can access the study, “Going to pot? The impact of dispensary closures on crime,” through ScienceDirect. Keep up with the latest developments in the growing cannabis industry by regularly visiting our news feed.

Contact the Department of Education for both your state and the state your school resides in for more information about available funding that includes grants, work-study programs, scholarships and tuition waivers. Individual schools offer grants, scholarships and other assistance for students, so discuss your needs with your school’s financial aid department. Even colleges with online programs offer online financial aid to students like you. Free money from private sources does exist, but you have to search for it. Talk with the schools you want to attend, and ask for information about scholarships. Fastweb and Student Scholarship Search provide numerous sources of scholarship money as well. Likewise, numerous civic groups give out traditional and online education scholarships every year. Contact Rotary International, Lions Club International, or other national and local civic groups for additional scholarship leads. If you’re a veteran, discuss your options with the Veterans Benefits Administration. Every branch of the military offers scholarships, and of course, the GI Bill is designed to help veterans attend college. Federal PLUS Loans are designed for parents with good credit. With low interest, they’re an option that finances your education. You should also discuss your needs with your local bank or credit union. They may offer loans and scholarships based on your FAFSA and sometimes additional forms like a CSS/Profile. Private bank loans may charge a higher interest than federal government loans. Allow your family, friends and strangers to donate money toward your educational pursuits when you participate in crowdfunding. Sites like gofundme.com can help your education become reality. Many students maintain their career through their educational pursuit. Maintaining your income stream while you’re attending classes, can ease the financial commitment and allow you to fund a portion of your education and life yourself. See our related articles below for additional tips on how to successfully pay for college. Money is a concern for most college students, but don’t let it hold you back from going to school.

Liverpool Network Theatre Group (formerly The Network) is a locally well-known non-professional company. LNTG was set up in 1984, nearly fifty years after the birth of its ‘grandparent’, the Merseyside Left Theatre Group (MLTG), to continue its work of encouraging participation, performance and new theatrical writing in Liverpool. Network directly replaced MLTG’s successor, the Merseyside Unity Theatre group (MUT) as an itinerant acting company, upon the establishment of the Unity Theatre building in Hope Place. The group was born out of the idea of theatre as a political force, with the power to change society for the better. This was epitomized by the dedication of our former chair, Graham Frood – a founder member of MLTG in the 1930s – who died, aged 88, in September 2003, within three months of giving his final Network performance. Liverpool Network Theatre Group is committed to staging high quality productions, accessible to ordinary people. Our plays range from Shakespeare and other classical works to modern dramas and comedies, including new local writing on occasion. We intend the issues in our productions to be relevant today, whatever the style and origin of the play. Typically, LNTG stages three or four public productions per year, in a variety of venues, including a summer show with performances in some of Liverpool’s parks and gardens. Open auditions are held for these. At the same time, many of our members contribute – both on and off stage – to other local professional, amateur and community theatre productions. LNTG offers low-cost weekly workshops on a “drop-in” basis, open to any member of the public over 18 years of age, These workshops, led by members or guests and covering a variety of acting ideas and techniques, run independently of any productions or rehearsal schedules. However, the director of a forthcoming show is always asked to lead a relevant workshop ahead of the audition process. It is the weekly, informal and varied workshop pattern which probably most distinguishes Network from other non-professional groups. An average workshop may be attended by 12-24 people, whose experience can range from fully-trained actors to first-time visitors. More often than not, complete newcomers, recent “regulars” and long-time members will take part in a workshop and socialise afterwards. Formal membership of LNTG is only required of those who take part in our public productions. Our Facebook group currently has over 1,900 members and our email list for bulletins includes almost 400 people.

Scottish Power Energy Networks organised a think–tank meeting in Edinburgh on 18th September 2018. Invitees included politicians, policy makers, bus operators, engineers and academics. Professor T Muneer from TRI was invited to give his views related to the introduction of electric vehicles within the City of Edinburgh fleet and the relevant implications.
Framing connectors are proprietary products and include fastener types such as; framing anchors, framing angles, joist, purling and beam hangers, truss plates, post caps, post anchors, sill plate anchors, steel straps and nail-on steel plates. Framing connectors are often used for different reasons, such as; their ability to provide connections within prefabricated light-frame wood trusses, their ability to resist wind uplift and seismic loads, their ability to reduce the overall depth of a floor or roof assembly, or their ability to resist higher loads than traditional nailed connections. Examples of some common framing connectors are shown in Figure 5.6, below. Framing connectors are made of sheet metal and are manufactured with pre-punched holes to accept nails. Standard framing connectors are commonly manufactured using 20- or 18-gauge zinc coated sheet steel. Medium and heavy-duty framing connectors can be made from heavier zinc-coated steel, usually 12-gauge and 7-gauge, respectively. The load transfer capacity of framing connectors is related to the thickness of the sheet metal as well as the number of nails used to fasten the framing connector to the wood member. Framing connectors are suitable for most connection geometries that use dimensional lumber that is 38 mm (2″ nom.) and thicker lumber. In light-frame wood construction, framing connectors are commonly used in connections between joists and headers; rafters and plates or ridges; purlins and trusses; and studs and sill plates. Certain types of framing connectors, manufactured to fit larger wood members and carry higher loads, are also suitable for mass timber and post and beam construction. Manufacturers of the framing connectors will specify the type and number of fasteners, along with the installation procedures that are required in order to achieve the tabulated resistance(s) of the connection. The Canadian Construction Materials Centre (CCMC), Institute for Research in Construction (IRC), produce evaluation reports that document resistance values of framing connectors, which are derived from testing results.
I have been having varying degrees of success building a simple VCO from the designs in Thomas's book Making Music with the 3080 OTA. The VCO section is working nicely now on my veroboard design. But my problems are with getting the current source to work correctly. I have tried building the "Easy Exponential Current Source" which ought to suit my needs. However the pots range is unusable. All the range is within the 1/3rd of central position on the pot - at either end (upper 1/3rd and lower 1/3rd) the VCO bottoms or tops out with the frequency remaining the same for the rest of the range. I can't work out how this is adjusted? Or why it should be so. Seems wrong that the super simple solution works better! If only the middle third of the pot is useful, add a 100k resistor between the 15v and the top of the pot and another 100k between the bottom of the pot and the -15v (assuming you are using a 100k pot). I've built that vco using the precision expo source and there is no stepping. I agree that you might have the transistors in wrong? I laid out my board (accidentally) for matched VBe BC560 type transistors vs. 2N3906 (the C/B/E pinouts are different for the different transistors--doh!). Helps to pay better attention to Eagle parts placement Just something to check I guess. With BC559's the current source worked perfectly for about 8 octaves. Trimmed out the V/oct by ear. Works great and temp compensation is good as well. I am having matched 2N3906 version fabbed up at EasyEDA now. I guess we'll see if that works....it should. Update. Matched 3906 version of the TH 3080/13600/13700 expo current source works great. I have tested on both 3080 and 13700. Yep, the thing really works. It's a really good design, simple and easy to build. hats off the the mighty TH! I'll post more on my website one of these days. Paul: one more thing I noticed when I was building this: make sure you have the right cap value in the VCO stage (tied to the OTA). I didn't when I was breadboarding and the thing only went to like 4K an never higher.
Because to me you always came first. You broke my heart into pieces. “love is not a destination love is a journey, as we grow in our lives so should love in our hearts”.

HelloID allows administrators to add variables to their own environment. These variables can then be used in scripts, tasks, and email templates. To get started, navigate to Automation > Variable Library in the HelloID Administrator Dashboard. In the User Defined Variables section, a new line is already present to accept a new variable. Follow these steps to add a new variable to your environment. Select the Type from its dropdown. In this example, we'll choose a string. Provide a Name for the variable. Spaces are not allowed. To separate words, use CamelCase or Snake_Case. In this example, we'll call our variable "exchange_server". Provide a value for the variable that corresponds with the chosen data type. In this example, we'll provide the value "exchange01". Click the plus sign (+) button to add the variable to your HelloID environment. The biggest benefit of using variables is that they reduce the effort of updating a value that is used in multiple places. Rather than having to make the update in multiple places, you can simply update the variables value. Wherever that variable is used, the new value will be present when the variable is evaluated. To update a variable's value, change its value in the Value column and click the Save button in the Variable Library window. Note: A variable's type and name values cannot be modified after the variable has been added to your HelloID environment. If the value of a variable is sensitive, and should be protected from shoulder-surfing, then you may hide its value in the form by clicking on the eye icon in the Actions column. Click Save in the Variable Library window to save your changes. To delete a variable, click its trashcan icon in the Actions column, and then click the Save button in the Variable Library window.
Fujifilm has introduced the GF 100-200mm F5.6 R LM OIS WR lens, which is the company’s latest super zoom Fujinon lens exclusively for medium format GFX series.

Currently, the Fujifilm GF 100-200mm F5.6 R LM OIS WR lens will be available for global pre-order on Bhphotovideo.com and selling will be starting on February 14th. with a price tag of $1,999.95.

In terms of design, this lens has an optical structure with 20 elements in 13 groups, in which there are 2 Super ED lens elements and 1 aspherical lens elements, which minimizes chromatic aberration and distortion to help capture images more perfect with high color reproduction. In addition, to ensure high performance for the lens, Fujifilm also equipped with a linear autofocus motor system that enables the camera to focus faster and quieter in combination with a locking mechanism, preventing movement. The need for lenses when the device is inactive increases the life of the lens more than other telephoto lenses. In addition, with the upgrade and change of the position of the linear motor cluster, the lens can keep the focusing position as before when the camera is turned off, making it possible to capture the focus much faster when shooting. The lens offers a 5.0-stop image stabilization performance, which means you can easily hold and manipulate shots without worrying about blurring. The lens’s weather-sealed construction makes it dust and weather resistant and capable of operating in temperatures down to -10°C, allowing you to shoot even in outdoors in light rain or in dusty conditions, and achieving a high level of reliability as photography equipment for professional photographers.
You might have lingered in the glamorous shopping malls, marveled at the aesthetics of Dubai’s skyline from the observation deck at the Burj Khalifa, befriended dolphins at the Atlantis, enjoyed pampering spa sessions at the nicest hotels in Dubai, partied with the city’s fashionable crowd and even had your fair share of market hopping in the old neighborhoods of Deira, but Dubai’s still got a lot more up its sleeve to surprise you. If you thought that you could cram a visit to the city in a stopover, then make no mistake–you will be missing the chance to enjoy the great outdoors. These day trips from Dubai present to you an interesting mix of nature, wildlife and heritage and are not to be missed if you want to peel back the layers a little and travel deeper. At 1,240 meters above sea level, Jabeel Hafeet, 140 kms away from Dubai, is not only the U.A.E’s second highest peak, it’s also one of the most scenic routes in the country. Located in the garden city of Al Ain, the road trip is very popular with local residents looking to escape the buzz of the city on weekends, especially in the cooler months. At the top, enjoy the magnificent views of Al Ain and Oman. On your way back, stop at Green Mubazzarah at the base of the mountain to dip your toes in the hot water springs that are believed to be therapeutic. A one and a half hour drive from Dubai, the emirate of Ras Al Khaimah is a popular day trip for residents and tourists, providing a pleasant change from Dubai’s urban cityscape with its raw and rugged landscape. You can even go on a safari to explore the desert. If you are more of a history buff, you will love to explore the 16th century Dhayah Fort and the mid-18th century National Museum of Ras Al Khaimah that served as the former residence of the ruling Al Qawasim family. Don’t forget the ghost town of Jazirat Al Hamra, one of the country’s oldest historical sites, a traditional fishing town that was abandoned by its residents around 40 years ago. Noteworthy is the coral stone architecture and the features of the township such as a fortress, school, market, houses, wind towers, mosques and courtyards. While in RAK, you can also visit the relaxing Khatt Hot Springs and spend some time in the mineral pools at the base of the scenic Hajar Mountains. Locals believe the springs have therapeutic qualities and you can ever book some time in a private pool. A one hour drive away from Dubai, Dibba on the east coast of the Musandam Peninsula makes for an ideal getaway. Nestled in the picturesque mountainous landscape of Oman, with its towering cliffs and fjords, Dibba is best and most conveniently experienced by a Dhow Cruise in a traditional boat. Active travelers will enjoy swimming, snorkeling, diving and kayaking in the pristine Arabian waters. You’re also likely to see dolphins and rich marine life. The town itself is very simple and the pace of life is slow as is usually the case outside cities. All visitors must bring their passports as you will be crossing into Omani territory.

pursuant to LA R.S. 9:2795.1." This law has been challenged and upheld. In May of 1973 the Louisiana Draft Horse Assocation was founded to promote family fun and entertainment, while restoring and re-enacting the uses of our forefather's main source of power - the horse! The original group, made up of 9 familiy units, quickly grew to 18 family units within the first few years. Family units were emphazied with the idea that today's family can work and play together by sharing in these activities, even as they did in yesteryear. At first these draft horse enthusiasts would get together on weekends to see what they could do with their horses. As the draft horses were new to this part of the country, interested people would come and see what they were all about. As more and more people came, the idea evolved into Old Farmer's Day! After a few years the other members of the Louisiana Draft Horse Association decided they didn't want anything to do with the event, so the Brunett Family took the reigns from there! So why October? Most visitors don't fully grasp the concept of why we host this event every year, but more specifically why exactly we hold it in October. Well the answer lies here....Old Farmer's Day is actually a national holiday! That's right, October 12 is a day devoted to old farmers and their farming techniques. Agriculture and farming today is largely mechanized and very scientific, but these developments would not have been possible without the wisdom and hard work of old farmers. While the origins of the holiday are unknown, Old Farmer's Day is celebrated by many across the nation as a throwback to sustainable and farm-to-table farming practices of the old days. This day is to give them thanks, to listen to them and to their stories, and to learn from them and their techniques. We strive to do this very same thing year after year, hence the reason we chose October as the time for our celebration! In the early 1990s a piece of family history was reguvinated, when the very kitchen Gerald's father built in 1904 became the center of attention at Old Farmer's Day.

A team of Wet Planet guides, both past and present, have embarked on a journey to Africa for the winter. Tyler Houck, David Wells, Trevor Sheehan, and friend Sean Eddington are exploring remote regions of southern Africa, focusing primarily on the Eastern Highlands of Zimbabwe. They are discovering new stretches of river on first descents, gathering water samples for a global micro plastic study, and documenting the adventure. They are also doing a lot of hiking through mountains with kayaks on their backs, building excellent shelters out of tarps, and on the rare occasion that they can find internet, sharing their stories and expertise. So you want to fly with your kayak? You must ask yourself some questions when thinking about flying with kayaks. Are there kayaks where I am going, for purchase or rent? Often times many domestic and international locations have boats for hire and for purchase. Some kayaking and rafting companies will rent them, and often a deposit for the boat is required. Many places may charge more than you think is reasonable, yet one must take into account how difficult it is for them acquire their kayaks which are used for their company. If you can’t get your kayak onto the airplane, try finding one at the local supermarket! For example in Africa most kayaks are imported and a hefty customs duty is added to the already expensive shipping cost. It may not be in the best interest of the company to rent their boats to someone they do not know to paddle down a new stretch. It is a kayaking adventure after all, and anything can happen. One can usually buy a kayak abroad, yet prices outside the United States are often much more, and the style of kayak may not be the latest design. It is always worth researching on social media and retailers to figure out how feasible it is to get your boof on! Okay, you are traveling to a remote area of the world and kayaks are not easy to get, and someone wants one thousand dollars for a welded boat. What is next? It is time to research the airlines baggage allowances and their restrictions on Sporting Equipment. Many airlines flat out ban kayaks. The word kayak becomes like Voldemort, it cannot be named. Ideally you already researched this before your ticket was purchased. If you did not, this is were deception and savviness is required in order to get your boat to that first descent on a jungle section somewhere downstream. Many airlines take surfboard and skis. I personally have flown with “skis” and “surfboards” to Uganda, a landlocked country in East Africa. I was quite nervous because I was using a Jackson Kayak, with the word kayak plastered all over it. I opted to put it in a Salamander boat bag and a smile. It worked, but many times it does not! The term “surfski” or sit down surfboard have been used, even a surfboard for the handicapped. There are lots of techniques, but know you will have to think on your feet and are breaking the airline’s baggage rules. Africa offering some amazing big water paddling! When in doubt you should channel Hendri Coetzee as he negotiated the worlds most dangerous places. In his book Living The Best Ever he explains his technique of different strategies. Firstly try “apologetic ignorance ‘I am terribly sorry sir, I just didn’t know the procedure.'” If that does not work try flattery and then onto guilt. Nothing yet?

For many of us though, the single greatest change, or life altering experience is the addition of our first child. Whether it’s learning the ropes of parenthood for the first time, or learning how to juggle multiple tiny humans all of a sudden, each child brings with it a new set of challenges. For me, the mindset approaching the birth of each of my three children, has been vastly different. Throughout my first pregnancy, I look back and think about how I just floated along in complete ignorance. After months and months of trying to fall pregnant, I could finally sit and imagine what my life with my new baby would be like. I was high on daydreams and fantasies about how my beautiful new baby would fit into my life, snuggle into my arms, and astound me with how perfect she would be. I very much struggled with how to fit this tiny human, with her own ideas bout life, into my scheduled and structured life. The reality of the situation was incredibly different. My first child wasn’t comfortable with the idea of sleep (nor was she for the first 3 years) which created some difficulty. I very much struggled with how to fit this tiny human, with her own ideas bout life, into my scheduled and structured life. I soon realised that no matter how much help you have around, or how calm and ‘cruisey’ your baby is, there are aspects of becoming a new mother that hurtle you back into reality, in a similar way that a tonne of bricks might hit the ground from a great height! My second pregnancy luckily happened very quickly, though came with it’s own set of challenges. We fell into the ‘It won’t happen straight away, so lets start trying earlier rather than later’ trap, and suddenly we’re staring at two tiny pink lines on the pregnancy test, a short 10 months after the birth of our first! Sadly, the day before, I started to miscarry. Kirsty McKenzie is a straight to the point mummy-blogger over at ‘The Mummysomniac’.

Schools can contain a variety of safety and health hazards, from hazardous chemicals in high school science laboratories to workplace violence, slips and falls, bloodborne pathogens, and more. The specific hazards in a particular school environment will depend on the type of school. An elementary school will pose different hazards than a university, for example. In addition to hazards that affect teaching staff, it is important to consider food service workers, janitorial staff, security personnel, and school nurses, just to name a few. Schools may also have contractors that come on-site to repair or perform maintenance to HVAC, electrical, or other systems, and these workers must be protected from on-site hazards and required to work safely. Safety and health requirements for public schools vary by state, as federal OSHA does not have jurisdiction over the public sector. Refer to this chart of public-sector safety and health requirements by state to determine which safety and health rules apply in your location. Private schools are regulated in the same way as other private sector workplaces. This chart will help private school employers determine what requirements apply in each state.

This petition was put forth by one of my previous guests on the Everything Ham Radio Podcast. Chris was my guest on episode 27 – Hams With Disabilities. Since that interview Chris and I have emailed back and forth a couple times and he had mentioned what he said in this petition to me. It is great to see that he put a petition into the FCC to try to make a change. What are yalls feelings about this petition? If there is anything you would change what would it be? Please leave a comment below and leave your comments about the petition on the FCC link shown in this article. The FCC is inviting comments on a Petition for Rule Making (RM-11775) from a Nevada radio amateur that seeks changes to the rules governing the Amateur Radio Vanity Call Sign Program. Christopher LaRue, W4ADL, of North Las Vegas, is proposing that any licensee obtaining a vanity call sign be required to keep it for the full license term. LaRue contends in his petition that excessive and frequent vanity call sign filings are hampering the ability of other qualified licensees to obtain vanity call signs in one of the more desirable 1 x 2 or 2 x 1 formats. LaRue said that since the FCC dropped the fee to file for a vanity call sign, some applicants are taking advantage by regularly obtaining new call signs, thereby keeping them out of circulation. Interested parties may comment using the FCC Electronic Comment Filing System (ECFS) at, https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/ . Comments are due within 30 days of the October 26 posting date.
I really love these events. There’s nothing like a table full of food, served family style, to inspire a true sense of community. This time around we did a pig roast and celebrated, friend and farmer, Jeff from Kingfisher Farms. It was his birthday and he turned the big 6-0! In this case, too many cooks in the kitchen made things all the more delicious! Many hands went into the culinary creations, including Julie DeJardin’s, who made up a decadent cheese dip while Jeff, Terri Desaro and I cooked up the rest of the feast. Fresh ingredients straight from Jeff and Nicole’s beautiful, local farm, only added to the flavor and goodness! Kingfisher Farms supplies several local eateries with delicious produce, including the highly regarded Portland restaurant, Wildwood. Many local business owners and artists were our guests including, Janice Gaines from the luxurious Spa Manzanita, marble sculptor, M.J. Anderson and artists, Julie Yanko and Scott Wilson (both have their wonderful work displayed at Manzanita’s only wine bar – Vino)!
Newark Symphony Hall last month completed $1.5 million in roof repairs and safety upgrades that made the 84-year-old deteriorating building on Broad Street habitable as a rental facility. But the work falls far short of a more significant investment needed to address years of neglect and return the building that once hosted such artistic greats as Marian Anderson and George Gershwin to its former stature. To rebuild Symphony Hall, its nonprofit operators will launch a $40 million capital campaign by next spring to generate public and private philanthropy for the needed renovations, which include new stage lighting; sound, heating and air-conditioning expansions; and other infrastructure improvements. Carl Miller, a maintenance worker, at the Sarah Vaughan Concert Hall's new theater at Newark Symphony Hall, which has undergone a $1.5 million renovation. Combined with city, county and state funding, the building's managers hope enough money is raised to complete the kind of renovations seen in recent years at the Union County Performing Arts Center in Rahway and the Welmont Theater in Montclair. "It's legacy needs to be preserved for future generations. We should be trying to maintain the historical venues that we have in the City of Newark, as opposed to let them deteriorate and become inactive," said Philip S. Thomas, executive director of the Newark Performing Arts Corp. On Saturday, the public is invited to help the city, which owns the building, and the hall's operators design the venue's future at a daylong conference billed as "Newark Symphony Hall Reimagined." Newark Mayor Cory Booker, who spurred symphony hall's renewal, said people have an interest in preserving the building that was once a gem in the city's downtown. "That facility has a very strong hold on the spirit and the imagination of a lot of residents here, and many residents have great stories about seeing shows and concerts or just going to events there as well," Booker said. Despite the recession, City Council President Mildred Crump said she is confident the campaign to raise funds will be a success. "Mindful of the fact that these are very difficult times, there are still people out there who were around when Newark Symphony Hall was where you went," said Crump, who serves on hall's board of directors. The building, also known as the Mosque and originally built by the Shriners as a Masonic Temple in 1925, had been the state's premier venue for a variety of famed entertainers and theater groups. Marian Anderson, William Warfield, George Gershwin, Tony Bennett and Patti LaBelle were among the major stars whose names went up on the marquee. The New Jersey Symphony Orchestra, New Jersey Ballet, New Jersey State Opera and African Globe Theater also have used the building. In addition, two television stations -- WNET Channel 13 and the Spanish-language WNJU Channel 47 -- have made their home in the hall. Changing priorities for the city, however, brought an era of deferred maintenance to the building, leaving it to deteriorate over the past two decades. With increasing competition from other area venues, fewer groups rented the Sarah Vaughan Concert Hall, Terrace Ballroom and a second-floor theater. Tenants who leased office space on the third and fourth floors also departed when water damage from a leaking roof made the spaces uninhabitable. Over the years, periodic repair work was done, but it wasn't enough, Thomas said. "If you're making constant repairs to the building, then it's going to start looking shabby. And if you're not replacing broken or worn-out or outdated mechanical systems, then they're going to break down." he said. In 2007, the Newark Performing Arts Council hired Thomas, a former vice president at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, to manage Newark Symphony Hall. Thomas reduced a deficit in annual operating expenses from more than $400,000 in 2007 to just over $65,000 last year, according to an update he prepared for the city council in February. He said he reduced costs by making hard decisions, such as canceling a summer program for about 100 Newark children one year and cutting his staff from 19 to 15 employees. Symphony Hall operates on a $2.1 million annual budget and relies on rentals of the building, tenant leases, concession revenues and a $650,000 donation from the city each year. Last year, the city invested $1.5 million for the roof repair and to help to bring the building up to city codes. Electric exit signs, emergency lighting, panic bars on doors and a computerized fire and smoke alarm system were installed for the entire building. Thomas said the work was the minimum for making Symphony Hall safe and that it was now primed for a major renovation. Symphony Hall has already received a $30,000 grant from PSEG Foundation to create a strategic plan. Crump said she also hopes to gain state support this week from New Jersey's Secretary of State Nina Wells and Jason Tramm, maestro of the New Jersey State Opera. The opera, she said, expects to return to Symphony Hall in 2010. Saturday's conference, featuring NJPAC President Lawrence P. Goldman and Newark historian Clement Price as speakers, begins at 8:30 a.m. and ends at 5:30 p.m. Registration forms are available at the box office. Crump said she already has her vision of how the building should be reimagined. "It takes me back to the day when you walked the red carpet as you entered Newark Symphony Hall," she said. "It takes me back to the day when every seat was filled." "Historic music hall has brighter days ahead"

We measured the electronic structure of Fe-substituted Bi2212 using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We find that the substitution does not change the momentum dependence of the superconducting gap but induces a very anisotropic enhancement of the scattering rate. A comparison of the effect of Fe substitution to that of Zn substitution suggests that the Fe reduces T c so effectively because it suppresses very strongly the coherence weight around the antinodes.
You'll learn to write and execute Matlab programs. Also, you'll learn the difference between a script file and a function file. A function file is also an M-file, just like a script file, but it has a function definition line on the top, that defines the input and output explicitly. You are about to create a MATLAB program! You'll write a function file to draw a circle of a specified radius, with the radius being the input of the function. You can either write the function file from scratch or modify the script file of this Tutorial Lesson. Open the script file prettycircle.m (created and saved before). On PCs, select 'Open' -> 'M-File' from the File menu. Make sure you're in the correct directory. Navigate and select the file prettycircle.m from the 'Open' dialog box. Double click to open the file. The contents of the program should appear in an edit window. On PCs, select 'Save As...' from the 'File' menu. A dialog box appears. Type the name of the document as prettycirclefn. Make sure the file is saved in the folder you want (the current working folder/directory of MATLAB). Click on the 'Save' icon to save the file. Notice that a function file must begin with a function definition line. In this case is function [x, y] = prettycirclefn(r), where you define the input variables and the output ones. a fixed part that never changes (the string 'Radius r= '), and a variable part that depends on the argumments passed on to the function, and that converts a number into a string (instruction 'num2str'). You can generate now a circle with an arbitrary radius, and that radius can be assigned to a variable that is used by your MATLAB program or function!
Thérèse Peltier, a talented sculptor, became the first woman to fly as a passenger in a heavier-than-air craft. On July 8, 1908 she made a flight of 656 feet with Léon Delagrange in Turin, Italy. She subsequently made several solo flights in a Voisin biplane but did not pursue a flying career. On her flight at the Military Square at Turin, she flew for two minutes and traversed a distance of 200 meters at an elevation of seven feet.

On the title track of Blackstar, released just a couple of days before his death, Bowie sings, “I’m not a pop star.” For me, and for his millions of fans, he was much more than that. He was someone who simply made us feel alive. This is what makes his death so hard to take. As the years passed, Bowie’s survival became more and more important to me. He continued. He endured. He kept going. He kept making his art. Bowie exerted a massive aesthetic discipline, created and survived. Indeed, survival became a theme of his art. Bowie’s death just feels wrong. How can we go on without him? Bowie incarnated a world of unknown pleasures and sparkling intelligence. He offered an escape route from the suburban hellholes that we inhabited. Bowie spoke most eloquently to the disaffected, to those who didn’t feel right in their skin, the socially awkward, the alienated. He spoke to the weirdos, the freaks, the outsiders and drew us in to an extraordinary intimacy, reaching each of us individually, although we knew this was total fantasy. But make no mistake, this was a love story. A love story that, in my case, has lasted about forty-four years. After hearing the news of Bowie’s death, I listened to him sing “nothing remains” – the opening words of “Sunday,” the languid first track on the 2002 album Heathen. The song seems now like a lamentation, a prayer or a psalm for the dead. Of course, it is extremely tempting to interpret these words in the light of Bowie’s death in the obvious way. Nothing remains for us after his death. All is lost. But this would be a huge mistake. As we’ve seen in this little book, the word “nothing” peppers and punctuates Bowie’s entire body of work, from the “hold on to nothing” of “After All”, from The Man Who Sold the World, through the scintillating, dystopian visions of Diamond Dogs and the refrain “We’re nothing and nothing can help us” from “‘Heroes’” and onward all the way to the triumph that is Blackstar, which might just be his best record in thirty years. Nothing is everywhere in Bowie. Its valences flit through so many of his songs. Does that mean that Bowie was some sort of nihilist? Does it mean that his music, from the cultural disintegration of Diamond Dogs, through the depressive languor of Low, on to the apparent melancholia of “Lazarus”, is some sort of message of gloom and doom? Within Bowie’s negativity, beneath his apparent naysaying and gloom, one can hear a clear Yes, an absolute and unconditional affirmation of life in all of its chaotic complexity, but also its moments of transport and delight. For Bowie, I think, it is only when we clear away all the fakery of social convention, the popery and jiggery-pokery of organised religion and the compulsory happiness that plagues our culture, that we can hear the Yes that resounds across his music. At the core of Bowie’s music and his apparent negativity is a profound yearning for connection and, most of all, for love. What was being negated by Bowie was all the nonsense, the falsity, the accrued social meanings, traditions and morass of identity that shackled us, especially in relation to gender and class. His songs revealed how fragile all these meanings were and gave us the capacity for reinvention. They gave us the belief that our capacity for changes was, like his, seemingly limitless. Of course, as I said earlier, there are limits, obviously mortal limits, to how far we can reshape ourselves – even for Bowie, who seemed eternal. But when I listen to Bowie’s songs I hear an extraordinary hope for transformation. And I don’t think I am alone in this. The core of this hope, which gives it a visceral register that touches the deepest level of our desire is the sense that, as he sings in “Rock ’n’ Roll Suicide,” “On no, love, you’re not alone”, the sense that we can be heroes, just for a day, and that we can be us just for a day, with some new sense of what it means to be us. This also has a political meaning. Bowie was often wrongly seen, particularly back in the 1970s, as some kind of right-wing nationalist (I note, with some pleasure, that Bowie, unlike Mick Jagger and Paul McCartney, turned down the offer of a knighthood from the Queen in 2003). Bowie will now never see those evergreens. But this is not just wistful nostalgia on his part, for they are nothing to him and nothing to see. Concealed in Bowie’s often dystopian words is an appeal to utopia, to the possible transformation not just of who we are, but of where we are. Bowie, for me, belongs to the best of a utopian aesthetic tradition that longs for a “yes” within the cramped, petty relentless “no” of Englishness. What his music yearned for and allowed us to imagine were new forms of being together, new intensities of desire and love in keener visions and sharper sounds. In my imaginings at least, this is how I choose to hear the quotation from the poet Hölderlin that begins this chapter. Bowie’s music permits us to imagine a future revolution in dispositions and ways of seeing. In hearing differently, we might be able to behave and see in a way that puts the past to shame. ‘Extract taken from On Bowie by Simon Critchley, published by Serpent’s Tail. Out now.
I love bags and backpacks. It had become quite an obsession in the last few years, and saw a lot of different options and manufacturers. I could tell within the first few weeks of using a bag whether it was going to be my primary bag for a long time, or if there were things about it that just didn’t make any sense. Then came along the Evernote Triangle Commuter Bag. I am a fanatic user of Evernote, and saw this when it was first released on their site. I was skeptical, as they’re not a big producer of bags. However, after looking at the pictures on their site, I decided to order one, as it looked like it had a lot of the features I would enjoy. The bag is very well made, with quality materials used throughout. Very easy to use zippers that feel like they will last a long time, durable fabric outside and in, and a quality feel everywhere. Usually there’s always a part of a bag that disappoints when it comes to the quality of what’s been used for materials, or a corner that is cut that you find after a few days use, but I haven’t found that here. The best part of the entire bag is it’s ability to stand up regardless of what you put in it. You can root around to find things in the bag, add and remove your laptop, and see everything in the pockets all without the bag moving a bit. The laptop slot is perfectly sized for my Lenovo Carbon X1 or MacBook Air, and still has a bit of room for some papers. Further inside is a deep area that you can segment with the included velcro dividers. This is similar to many camera bags, and is a great way of giving folks flexibility for various setups. You can lay down the velcro dividers in the bottom for storage so they’re not in the way. There are two small pockets on either end inside the bag, and then one larger and one smaller flat pockets right against the laptop section. These are great to store letters, checkbook and other random things. On the flap that folds down once you’ve unzipped things are two pockets to store loose items. One is mesh, and I use to store adapters and such, and the other is solid. The storage inside this bag is deceivingly larger than what it looks like from the outside. The triangle shape gives you a lot more space in the bottom of the bag, and the fact that it won’t tip over is amazing. Wonderful design. The front of the bag also has a mesh-like leather pocket, but I’ve not used it yet. Evernote says you can use it for iPhone and other devices you need to get a hold of quickly. It does have a lot of room in it, and would be a good place for quickly needed items. The bag is made for Evernote by abrAsus, not someone I’m that familiar with, but in reading various other reviews online, and using the bag for a couple of weeks, they sure have figured out how to develop an elegant bag. Overall, this is the best bag I have ever owned, and that’s saying a lot. I have had easily 50 bags in the last 5 years (maybe more) and always get frustrated within the first week. This one has shown none of that, and does even more than most bags could for storage, organization, looks, and functionality. And the fact that it’s from Evernote is just icing on the cake.
February 21, 2018: Dollar (or less) Darlin's! All the cheap vinyl I scored before my trip to Florida made up for scoring NO vinyl in Florida!! Almost all the records are packed up! We had a water incident which damaged no records in our home record library, but it means that we had to pack almost everything up for a few weeks for repairs. Luckily next week Joe Belock is my special guest! He's got good records!!!! My second-favorite Connie 45 ("Don't Ever Leave Me" is tops")! @Glynis: Hope things works out — water issues in the home is no joke. I'll take "Summer and Sandy" off your hands for a buck. The water problem was very brief. Asbestos abatement tomorrow before we can start replacing the drywall. Let's hope they can get the record shelf off the wall easily without having to destroy it. The shelf builder doesn't want to make another one. Yikes! Good luck with the asbestos/shelf removal. Insurance sends the guys, so it's up to them to get it right. Stay Tuned for the Fringe Factory! Thanks for tuning in!
I joined the U.S. Army at 19 years old, after growing up in Billerica, MA, and spent seven years in the service. I did two tours in Afghanistan and spent time working as a nurse and medic. After my discharge, I was trying to figure out where to go next – maybe school, maybe work. And I found myself thinking back to when I wanted to be a firefighter, which was really about wanting to help others in their times of need. As a military medic, I spent much of my time focused on trauma and traumatic injuries, much like an EMT, helping others as I’d always wanted to. When I returned to Massachusetts, my Army experience as a medic qualified me for EMT certification. I liked working in ambulances in hands-on, fast-paced emergency situations and realized that the next step in my career would be to become a full paramedic. Why Pro EMS Center for MEDICS? The question for me was to figure out specific next steps in continuing my education to become a paramedic. Did I want to go to college? Or did I want more specialized training? After meeting with the team at Pro EMS Center for MEDICS, I knew it was the right place for me. The program actually feels similar to some of my training in the military – hands-on, situational, experiential learning in simulated environments. It felt familiar and I knew it worked. Some of the CFM instructors also come from a military background, and it was helpful to have that common experience. It gave me confidence in my decisions to know that others had walked the same path I was on. As an Army Medic, I had some experience with suturing, starting IVs, airway management, and other emergency procedures. The program and instructors at CFM are able to build on the skills I already had to give me a fully developed and complete paramedic education. The combination of classroom and clinical, real-world learning is invaluable and really helps all students understand and retain the concepts and procedures needed in emergency situations. Research all the different types of educational opportunities open to you through the G.I. Bill. Using those resources to further my education at Center for MEDICS has been incredibly rewarding for me. When you’re trying to figure out what comes after a military career, make a plan and a backup plan. Be thorough about your research before making any decisions, because it can be hard to change paths once you’re on one. But if you know yourself, take some initiative, and work towards a goal you can achieve what you want to.

Why Do Some Adult Children of Alcoholics Become Workaholics and Perfectionists? - Sharon Martin, LCSW Counseling San Jose and Campbell, CA ? Why do some adult children of alcoholics become workaholics? “Work first. Play later.” That’s the motto Elizabeth grew up with. It was hard for her to relax and enjoy things when there was work to be done, a project left unfinished, or something still on her to-do list. She was more comfortable working than having fun. Play and rest just seemed like a waste of time. Elizabeth had always been a hard worker. She was proud of her work ethic and it had certainly served her well in many regards. She was advancing at work, her boss counted on her, and she was earning decent money. If you’re a high-achiever, perfectionist, workaholic, or overly responsible adult child of an alcoholic, (addicted or otherwise dysfunctional parent) you know exactly how Elizabeth felt — compelled to work incessantly and uncomfortable resting and relaxing. Work and busyness can easily become your identity and your self-worth. Productivity is a way to prove your worth. Work is a form of people-pleasing. Work can be a way to avoid difficult feelings, people, and problems. Elizabeth would only rest or do something fun after all of her work was done. The problem was that the work was never done. There was always more work she could do. There was a never-ending pile of dishes to wash, more household repairs to do, and more emails to answer. She’d redo work until it was perfect. And she’d multitask because being doubly or triply productive seemed to be the only way she felt adequate. Like Elizabeth, we overschedule and stay super busy because we’re uncomfortable relaxing and having down time. We don’t want to be seen as lazy, or a failure, or ungrateful. We don’t want to be alone with our thoughts. By constantly working and doing, we’re trying to stave off criticism (from others and ourselves) and ensure that we’re earning our keep. Adult children of alcoholics often mistakenly believe that work is the important stuff and that play is optional. Work always comes first because that’s how we prove that we’re worthy of love and acceptance. We’re afraid that if we aren’t perfect and productive, then we won’t be needed, wanted, or liked. We struggle to just “be”. We’d rather “do” because serving, contributing and working prove that we matter. Rest, relaxation, and play can feel unnatural if you weren’t encouraged or allowed to do so as a child. Not everyone grows up in an environment where they feel safe, secure, and loved just as they are. Some kids have to constantly prove themselves and convince people that they deserve to be loved and taken care of. They have to be “on” all the time. Relaxing can feel unsafe; it’s letting your guard down and possibly missing warning signs that something bad is going to happen. Children in alcoholic (or addicted or otherwise dysfunctional) families grow up to be adults who constantly feel like they have to prove their worth through achievements, awards, grades, diplomas, and other outward signs of success. They don’t know how to relax and just be themselves. As I mentioned, children in alcoholic or dysfunctional families feel like they have to earn their parents love by being perfect children — making the honor roll, excelling at sports and music, taking care of their siblings, following the rules, and so on. Anything less than perfect (even a B on a report card or being second string on the football team) results in severe criticism or punishment. The same is true if you do something for yourself. Perhaps you were late coming home after school because you were hanging out with friends (a completely normal thing to do). Your mother might yell at you and call you selfish and lazy. These messages stay with you into adulthood. You remain afraid to let people down. You don’t want to do anything that might be displeasing to others or result in criticism. Overworking becomes a way to protect yourself from upsetting people. If you weren’t taught that you have intrinsic value, you’ll always be seeking external validation, praise, and reassurance that you’re good enough. This, of course, leads to feeling like you’re worth is tied to your productivity and others are only happy with you when you’re working, earning money, or contributing something. Work is always commonly used as a form of avoidance. Growing up in a dysfunctional family, you weren’t taught how to deal with difficult emotions in healthy ways. You may have witnessed your parents use alcohol or drugs, avoidance, rage or violence to deal with their problems. Your parents may not have been very attuned to their own feelings or yours — leaving you without much awareness of your feelings and a tendency to numb them with food, alcohol, or work. And since hard work, being responsible, and being busy are generally seen as positives, you may not even be aware that you’re using work as a way to avoid your feelings, problems at home, or “emotional baggage”. Even if you’re not the adult child of an alcoholic or addict, you may have gotten rather mixed up messages about work and rest. Perhaps your parents worried a lot about money or what the neighbors thought. They may have modeled over-working with all of the best intentions. The point is, if no one showed you that rest is also valuable, you’re going to function from the “work first, play later” mentality and play and rest will easily be shoved to the side in order to make room for more of what feels right and validating to you. Making time for rest and play will actually increase productivity, but that’s not really the point. If you’re a goal-oriented, high-achiever, you don’t need to be more productive. Adult children of alcoholics can learn how to feel content with doing less. You can practice being still and quiet. You can learn to relax your body and mind in order to rest. You can retrain your thinking and remind yourself that you don’t constantly have to prove yourself. Perhaps life isn’t just about doing as much work as you possibly can. Perhaps people will love you and value you even if you slow down, take a break, or do something just for the fun of it. If this isn’t’ how you naturally think, it’s going to take practice. It’s hard to untangle the messages we get as children. Start with awareness. Notice the things you say to yourself about rest and work and what you deserve. Notice the messages other people give you about work and worthiness. Listen to your body and try to notice if it’s asking you to slow down and give it a rest. Change is always a process. For now, start with the idea that love and acceptance don’t have to be earned. Try on the idea that your worth as a person isn’t based on what you can achieve, how much you earn, or how much work you can do today. You are enough just as you are and I hope you’ll let that thought in and give it a chance to grow. This post is adapted from a post originally published by the author on PsychCentral.com.
